            <h3>The Whys</h3>
            <p>In the autumn of 2006, with the support of the Iran Society, I travelled to Iran to research material for a new course that I had been invited to develop for the British Museum’s World Arts and Artefacts programme. The World Arts and Artefacts programme is a joint venture between Birkbeck and the British Museum and the course was to be a prac.</p>
            <h3>The hows</h3>
            <p>From the extraordinary tradition of Persian geometric art, I had never visited Iran. For this reason I was very keen to visit the country and to study the patterns in both theportunity to meet and interview a number Irani.</p>

            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>The contrast between a heavenly orientation and a more earthly one is most clearly realised in the city plan of Isfahan, where the main square (Naqsh-e Jahan) is orientated according to the cardinal directions and the Shah mosque at the southern end of the square has its main axis offset according to qibla (direction of Mecca). Titus Burckhardt, in his extensive monograph Art of Islam – Language and Meaning, observes that this shift marks “the transition from the outward to the inward world, a swift re-orientation of the soul.” (Burckhardt 1976, p. 171)</p>
            <p>Aside from wishing to uncover something of the symbolic dimension of the geometric motifs, it was also essential for me to study the practical aspects of designing and building with this visual language. Through my contacts at the University of Isfahan, I was very fortunate to have a numbe</p>
