            <p>In the autumn of 2006, with the support of the Iran Society, I travelled to Iran to research material for a new course that I had been invited to develop for the British Museum’s World Arts and Artefacts programme. The World Arts and Artefacts programme is a joint venture between Birkbeck and the British Museum and the course was to be a practical one, focusing specifically on geometric design within the Persian tradition[1]. Whilst I have traveled widely throughout the Middle East and my own work, as a painter, printmaker and tile mosaicist, draws considerable inspiration from the extraordinary tradition of Persian geometric art, I had never visited Iran. For this reason I was very keen to visit the country and to study the patterns in both their cultural and architectural context. I was in the country for four weeks, visiting Isfahan, Shiraz, Kerman, Mahan, Yazd and Kashan, and was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet and interview a number Iranian academics, as well as local craftsmen.</p>

            <p>I was first drawn to my study of Islamic art through an interest in mystical philosophy and Pythagorean thought in particular. For many years I have been struck by what can only be described as the numinous quality of Islamic patterns and the sense of sublime tranquility that one experiences in Islamic buildings. I have often wondered whether there is a connection between the presence of geometry and the nurturing of a contemplative state. A closely related question is whether there is a symbolic dimension to the articulation of architectural space. Such thoughts were on my mind when I first arrived in Isfahan. At the time I was reading Henry Corbin’s “The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism”, a book about the spiritual symbolism of orientation. “Orientation”, Corbin writes, “is a primary phenomenon of our presence in the world. A human presence has the property of spatialising the world around it” (Corbin 1971, p. 1). Corbin is not merely concerned with our material orientation to the four cardinal dimensions, but rather “the way in which man inwardly experiences the ‘vertical’ dimension of his own presence” This relates to a common theme within Iranian Sufi literature: the “Quest for the Orient”. This quest is not, it should be emphasised, for an orient that is located on geographical maps, but rather, “the supersensory, mystical Orient, the place of the Origin and of the Return, object of the eternal quest … the heavenly pole.” (Ibid, p. 2)</p>
