its initial public offering at $21 to $24 a share.  At the midpoint of that
range, the offering would value the company at $3.6 billion. Like many other
technology start-ups, Workday, founded in 2005, will have a dual-class share
structure, with each Class B share having 10 votes. Its co-chief executives,
David Duffield, the founder of PeopleSoft, and Aneel Bhusri, who was chief
strategist at PeopleSoft, will have 67 percent of the voting rights after
the I.P.O., according to the prospectus." />

              <p>In the autumn of 2006, with the support of the Iran Society, I travelled to Iran to research material for a new course that I had been invited to develop for the British Museum’s World Arts and Artefacts programme. The World Arts and Artefacts programme is a joint venture between Birkbeck and the British Museum and the course was to be a practical one, focusing specifically on geometric design within the Persian tradition[1]. Whilst I have traveled widely throughout the Middle East and my own work, as a painter, printmaker and tile mosaicist, draws considerable inspiration from the extraordinary tradition of Persian geometric art, I had never visited Iran. For this reason I was very keen to visit the country and to study the patterns in both their cultural and architectural context. I was in the country for four weeks, visiting Isfahan, Shiraz, Kerman, Mahan, Yazd and Kashan, and was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet and interview a number Iranian academics, as well as local craftsmen.</p>
              <p>I was first drawn to my study of Islamic art through an interest in mystical philosophy and Pythagorean thought in particular. For many years I have been struck by what can only be described as the numinous quality of Islamic patterns and the sense of sublime tranquility that one experiences in Islamic buildings. I have often wondered whether there is a connection between the presence of geometry and the nurturing of a contemplative state. A closely related question is whether there is a symbolic dimension to the articulation of architectural space. Such thoughts were on my mind when I first arrived in Isfahan. At the time I was reading Henry Corbin’s “The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism”, a book about the spiritual symbolism of orientation. “Orientation”, Corbin writes, “is a primary phenomenon of our presence in the world. A human presence has the property of spatialising the world around it” (Corbin 1971, p. 1). Corbin is not merely concerned with our material orientation to the four cardinal dimensions, but rather “the way in which man inwardly experiences the ‘vertical’ dimension of his own presence” This relates to a common theme within Iranian Sufi literature: the “Quest for the Orient”. This quest is not, it should be emphasised, for an orient that is located on geographical maps, but rather, “the supersensory, mystical Orient, the place of the Origin and of the Return, object of the eternal quest … the heavenly pole.” (Ibid, p. 2)</p>

              <p>The contrast between a heavenly orientation and a more earthly one is most clearly realised in the city plan of Isfahan, where the main square (Naqsh-e Jahan) is orientated according to the cardinal directions and the Shah mosque at the southern end of the square has its main axis offset according to qibla (direction of Mecca). Titus Burckhardt, in his extensive monograph Art of Islam – Language and Meaning, observes that this shift marks “the transition from the outward to the inward world, a swift re-orientation of the soul.” (Burckhardt 1976, p. 171)</p>
              <p>It’s worth comparing this symbolic orientation with that of the Christian church, where the central axis is aligned towards the rising sun at the Spring equinox (the symbol of the risen Christ). Whereas the axes of all oriented churches run in parallel, the axes of all mosques and the direction of prayer converge on a single geographical point of the Ka’ba in Mecca. It is only when a gathering of the faithful bow down in common prayer in close proximity around the Ka’ba that this convergence becomes most strikingly apparent. It is important to remember that Ka’ba actually means cube, and the cube is linked to the very idea of the centre, its six faces integrating the four cardinal directions, with the zenith and the nadir, that is, the ontological axis linking Heaven, Earth and underworld. The Ka’ba does not entirely correspond to this scheme, as its four corners more closely correspond the cardinal directions, but this does not detract from a primordial symbolism which predates Islam. According Burckhardt, the ‘axial’ character of the Ka’ba is affirmed according to a well known Muslim legend in which the ‘ancient house’, first built by Adam, was destroyed by flood and then re-built by Abraham and is situated at the base of an axis which traverses the heavens (Burckhardt 1976, p.4). The rite of circumambulation (tawaf) is seen to reproduce the rotation of the heavens around this polar axis, which, in terms of geometric symbolism, could be seen as the archetypal reconciliation of heavenly circle with earthly square.</p>
              <p>As I collected visual samples of the many different symmetries employed in the decorative schemes of the buildings in Isfahan, I was very aware of the variety of ‘sunwheel’ (swastika) motifs, commonly displaying both a clockwise and an anti-clockwise turn, or ‘spin’. This motif occurs across a range of cultures. Far from being an exclusively Eastern symbol, the motif is found both in the Far East and Far West, existing amongst indigenous American tribes as recently as the early 20th century (Guenon 2004, p. 54). It is often said to symbolise the rotation of the four elements or seasons around a motionless centre. In Isfahan, I was told that it is essentially a Shi’a symbol, an example of pili – a design in which the name of Ali is encrypted, rotated and reflected. The great Sufi scholar and metaphysician Rene Guenon offers a more a esoteric reading of the design in which it is said to represent the “sign of the Pole” (Guenon 2004, p. 55), the motionless heavenly axis around which the Earth, represented by a cross, revolves, the trailing arms signifying the direction of rotation, or ‘spin’. This direction is, of course, is reversed depending upon whether one is considering the North or the South pole, and both directions of spin are very often represented together in the buildings of Iran.</p>

              <p>Aside from wishing to uncover something of the symbolic dimension of the geometric motifs, it was also essential for me to study the practical aspects of designing and building with this visual language. Through my contacts at the University of Isfahan, I was very fortunate to have a number of meetings arranged for me with craftsmen and artisans in the area of Isfahan. The first two images below are from a moaraq (tile mosaic) craft workshop. In this technique each individual piece is cut from a ready glazed ceramic tile to a precise shape with a sort of ‘twin beaked’ hammer. The numbered pieces are then assembled jigsaw fashion face down on the floor, before plaster is poured onto the back of the mosaic to create one solid piece. This can then be dispatched and carefully installed on-site. It is a mark of the precision of work achieved by these craftsman that fine pieces of detailed biomorphic design can be assembled seamlessly, leaving no mortar line. I have visited similar workshops in Morocco, where the same procedure is used for creating zillij work. In Morocco, the tasks are performed by children and the general set-up is rather more hierarchical. A child might, for example, spend a couple of years simply marking out tiles, before later moving up to the more skilled task of precise cutting. The twin-beaked hammer is, however, practically the same. The design of this tool dates back at least at least to the Roman era and is used to cut the marble tessarae of traditional Roman mosaic. It can still be purchased in Italy.</p>

              <p>In the countryside outside of Isfahan, I visited the busy workshop of a Mr Oshaghi, a master craftsman and practitioner of gereh-chini, a traditional woodwork technique involving the assembly of small wooden pieces into elaborate geometric designs. He showed me his studio and was happy for me to document how he would set about constructing a traditional pattern. Mr Oshaghi had learnt his skills from his father and he was gradually passing them on to his sons (now grown men), who were always with him within the studio. I was interested to learn the similarities and differences between how he and I would go about developing a geometric design. The image below shows Mr Oshaghi demonstrating the construction of a pattern involving 10-fold symmetry. He did not work with a leaded compass, as I would myself, but would start by incising a circle into the paper with a pair of dividers. The paper had previously been left out in the sun to go brittle and lightly browned, so that the dividers would score a faintly legible line when marking it. This would then be worked over freehand with a pencil. Mr Oshaghi began with the creation of a shamsa, literally ‘little sun’. In the case of 10-fold symmetry this would take the form of a decagram, or 10 pointed star. The decagram is progressively broken down in order to find the classical elements of 10-fold symmetry. The pattern is then developed through intelligent extension of parallels forming a network of lines, at the intersections of which the design emerges.</p>
              <p>This technique of using compass and unmarked straight edge is essentially the one that I use myself and is common throughout the Islamic world. Mr Oshaghi also showed me some rather more innovative work involving 7-fold symmetry. He was, however, rather more reticent about revealing the method underlying these more original designs. This was perfectly natural. I would have felt the same about revealing my professional secrets to a stranger.</p>

              <p>The image to the right above shows a very important stage in the drawing. The diamond shape is a very particular rhombus with key proportions. The ratio of its edge length to its overall height is 1 to the golden section. The golden section, also known as Phi (named after the Greek sculptor Phidias, who used it in the design in the Parthenon) is commonly represented by the symbol F and is an irrational number. Its approximate value is 1.61803…, the number of decimal places is unending. A pocket calculator will offer you an approximation if you enter the values (√5+1)/2. The Greeks, who had neither calculators nor decimals, called such numbers “unutterables”. Despite this limitation, these values could be determined geometrically (through drawing) with great precision and the proportional ratios derived from them were used by the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks to proportion their architectural spaces and to generate harmonious designs (Ghyka 1977, Olsen 2006). Within the Islamic tradition such proportions underlie the designs of all architectural spaces and geometric patterning. There are, however, different regional emphases. In the Magrib and Andalucia, there is a preference for patterns based on the proportional ratios related to √2 and √2 + 1. These are used in the facades of the Alhambra in Granada, the plan of the Qarawiyyn mosque in Fez and the proliferation of patterns with 8, 16 and 32 petal rosettes throughout Morocco. In the Umayyad mosque in Damascus the walls are beautifully adorned with bold cut-stone geometric designs deploying √3 symmetry. In Iran the preference is for patterns based on the golden section and the 5 and 10-fold symmetries derived from it.</p>
              <p>So what is it about using these particular ratios that leads to harmonious designs? One characteristic of using these proportions within patterns is that the same elements of the patterns recur at different scales. Mathematicians often describe this as the principle of ‘self-similarity’, an essential characteristic of fractals. ‘Self-similarity’ is the key to understanding the peculiar resonance between these proportions and patterns in the natural world. In animals, the most permanent bodily tissues, such as bones, teeth, horns and shells all develop through growth by accretion, where smaller elements are related to larger elements by the same proportion. The golden section itself, often rendered by the formulation ‘the smaller to the larger is as the larger to the whole’, is very much the signature of living forms. It underlies the proportioning of bones in the human body, as well as the structuring of the DNA spiral.</p>
