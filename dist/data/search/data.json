[["ZLEIKHA MOUHTASEB PALESTINIAN CITIZEN.","It’s empty because the settlers living above always throw stuff at us. Garbage, stones, dirty water, sand, glass, chemicals…. People have put this net for protection. Dirty water, urine, rotten eggs….","Gideon Levy: a journalist who evokes strong emotions from fellow Israelis. His columns for the Tel Aviv-based Haaretz newspaper often focus on Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. For some Israelis, he is a brave disseminator of the truth, but many others condemn him as a propagandist for Hamas.","He doesn't deserve to be on TV. Go to Al Jazeera. They'll love you there!","He represents the Palestinians and Hamas. Not our country.","One of his earlier reports was of an incident back in 1996, that involved the Abu Dahouk family.","HUSSEIN ABU DAHOUK PALESTINIAN CITIZEN.","I was at my mother's place that night. She woke me up so I could drive my sister-in-law, who was in labour, to the hospital.","I was driving them when we reached a checkpoint. The soldiers stopped me. I asked them to let me pass to take my sister-in-law to the hospital. They refused. So I drove to another checkpoint, but faced the same problem. I went to the Ras Al-Amood checkpoint. It was getting very late. The soldiers there also refused to let me pass. When I returned to the car I discovered she had delivered the baby. My mother told me to stop arguing with the soldiers. She held the baby and walked with my sister-in-law to the hospital. I returned home.","FAYZEH ABU DAHOUK PALESTINIAN CITIZEN. My mother-in-law urged me on as we walked all the way. Until we reached the hospital. They did the tests. But the baby was very weak. I told the doctor I had delivered him in the car at the checkpoint. He discharged me but kept the baby in the hospital. The baby died the next day.","I wanted to name him Yousef.","Commenting on this incident Israeli journalist Gideon Levy wrote an article entitled \"Death of a Baby\" on the 19th of April 1996.","Who the hell are they? Who are those soldiers who saw Fayzeh Abu Dahouk in pain as she delivered her baby in her brother-in-law's car. Who are those soldiers who didn't let her pass to reach the hospital?\"","Who are those soldiers who made Fayzeh have to wrap her baby in her clothes and walk two kilometres to reach the hospital?\"","BASSEM EID HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST.","In 1988, I joined B'Tselem. It documents human rights violations by Israeli soldiers and settlers against Palestinians inside the occupied Palestinian territories.","One time I heard settlers were burning and cutting down trees in Bedya village.","I called the Haaretz journalist Gideon Levy and asked him to go there to see what the settlers had done and write about it.","I remember the first trip to Bedya village, near the West Bank city of Nablus, in May 1989.","Hello Abu Ayman. How are you?","- Fine. Thank you.","GIDEON LEVY ISRAELI JOURNALIST.","When I joined Haaretz newspaper, I started to visit the occupied territories.","I figured out three things.","I gradually started to understand the brutality and inhumanity of the occupation.","I figured out three things. First, this was the biggest drama facing the state of Israel. Second, this story was not being covered by the Israeli media. And third, this was going to be my life mission.","I wanted to report about the Israeli occupation to Israeli readers who did not want to know about the bad things happening there. To truly understand how inhumane and brutal the Israeli occupation is.","YUSUF ABU SAFIYEH PALESTINIAN FARMER.","Destroying these olive trees harms the farmers. They spend their lives taking care of these trees, and then someone just sets them on fire. This tree is the same as those. It is more than 80 years old. It used to give us 30 kilos of olive oil each year. Hundreds of trees have been cut down and set on fire. Settlers pass by at any time and cut down and burn our trees as if the trees were their enemy. These trees are our source of living. Many have lost their olive trees. The settlers cut them down and stole the olives. Sometimes they even enter our village and attack people. They once opened fire on a house with people inside. We couldn't defend ourselves. No one confronts those settlers. There is nothing we can do. Settlers come here backed up by soldiers.","On the 5th of May 1989, Gideon Levy wrote: The residents of Bedya make a living from olive trees. Unknown attackers have cut down their olive trees on 12 occasions. You can see cut trees in every farmyard in the village. The attackers cursed and threw stones at the farmers. But none of them were arrested.","[Levy] History has witnessed worse and more brutal occupiers than the Israelis.","But I've never heard about an occupation that believes it is the victim. And the only victim.","Israelis believe the Arabs are so guilty that they force us to kill their children.","Let's not forget there is an ongoing attempt to dehumanise the Palestinians. To make it easier for us to kill them. If they are not humans like us, then there is no problem in attacking them!","[Hebron] [The West Bank] [soldier] You have a document proving it's your house?","[woman] You expect me to have that document with me all the time?","[soldier] wait there.","[man] You should have the property document all the time.","[woman] They are my guests.","[soldier] Wait there.","[Levy] What's happened now? [Woman] I tried to go into my house. They said do you have a document to show this is your house. I said I don't have a document. They said ok, wait here.","[Levy] This place makes me really depressed. It is the essence of criminality. The walls speak here. So do the shops and the thousands of empty houses. If this is not the real meaning of apartheid, then I don't know what is!","[Bassem] Our second trip was to Qasabah neighbourhood in Nablus.","One of the most dangerous areas in the first Intifada. Most of the Palestinians killed in Nablus were killed in Qasabah.","Levy, an Israeli wanted to spend the night there to witness the Israeli soldiers' practices at night.","Only then I knew that this man truly believed in what he was reporting.","[Levy] I've seen it all. I've seen children killed. Their parents killed. Injured people. Farms on fire. Cars and houses burnt. Shepherds whose cattle were stolen. Farmers whose lands were confiscated. And so many detainees.","[Levy] I can understand why a young man would carry out a suicide operation in Tel Aviv. I think every suicide bomber who killed women and children would have preferred to sit in an air-conditioned helicopter, press a button and fire a rocket at Salah Shehada's house in Gaza. To kill 15 children and a woman and still be viewed as innocent, not a terrorist. Terrorism is a weapon used by the weak. It is a terrible weapon and I am completely against it. But I understand where it comes from. It comes from despair.","[Tel Aviv] BEN DROR YEMENI ISRAELI JOURNALIST, MAARIV.","I have no problem with criticism. Constructive criticism against Israel. Its policies and settlements. The occupation. That is fine. But to describe a state as a monster! That is not criticism, t's denying its legitimacy. In this way, you are reducing the chances for reaching peace. Peace can't be reached with the devil. You simply have to get rid of this devil because it is dangerous and it commits crimes against humanity. And it doesn't deserve to exist. Gideon Levy is not criticising Israel. He is portraying it as the devil and that's very dangerous.","[Bassem] Gideon Levy definitely plays an important role in criticising Israeli policies. Gideon Levy's popularity increased when Haaretz started to issue a daily English-language edition. I believe millions of people in Europe read Haaretz online every Friday morning just to check what Gideon Levy has written.","[Jalazon refugee camp, the West Bank] [Bassem] We are now in the Jalazon refugee camp near the house of Awad Hendash. In April 1994, Awad was shot from behind by Israeli soldiers. He died on the spot. I called Levy. We came here to investigate what had happened. It was published in the Haaretz. FATIMA HENDASH AWAD'S MOTHER.","Awad was married to an American girl. He was preparing the required documents so he could join her in the U.S. On that day, he was supposed to go and pick up his documents. He used to work polishing cars. He wanted to finish his work before leaving.","[Bassem] Israeli soldiers parked their jeep on that road and came here on this roof without asking the permission of the owner of the house. When I was investigating the incident, I remember I saw a tent here. Awad was there near that green door. They called him and asked him to approach them.","[Fatima] He went over to them. They asked him who had thrown stones. He said he didn't do anything. He explained he had traces of polish on his hands One soldier then asked him which house was his. He said: \"There. My mum is standing there\". The soldier told him to leave. I turned around and started to go up the stairs, and then heard the gunfire.","Three bullets struck him in the back.","One of the soldiers had a yellow paper with a skull drawn on it. He lifted it up and said: 'Just like Afula.'","Apparently there had been an operation in Afula. They took revenge on Awad for it.","In an article entitled \"Awad's Last Car\" Gideon Levy wrote in May 1994 Eyewitnesses said the soldier had deliberately opened fire on Hendash with no prior warning. Hendash had never fired on the soldier. Hendash had never endangered the soldier's life. He had only approached him after the soldiers had ordered him to do so.","RAMADAN HENDASH AWAD'S BROTHER.","He reached this point and started screaming. He fell over. I looked at the soldiers and tried to drag my brother away. They opened fire on us.","I called for help. I put him in a car and we left. He stopped moving shortly before we reached Ramallah.","[Fatima] Only God knows how we feel. We remember him all the time. As if he had only just died.","That is how we are.","[Levy ] I often feel ashamed of what is being done in my name. I feel really guilty towards the Palestinians. I think we are doing terrible things to them.","Golda Meir once said that Jews had the right to do anything after the holocaust.","Levy During the intifada, I once arrived at a checkpoint near Jenin. I saw a Palestinian ambulance with its lights flashing. I waited for more than 40 minutes and then couldn't stay silent. I got out of my car to see what was happening. I saw the Israeli soldiers playing board games in a tent. I shouted at them. They got angry when I told them to imagine it was their father in that ambulance dying while they played. Israelis hate it when you ask them to imagine themselves in the Palestinians' place. They were so angry they pointed their guns at me.","[Hebron] [The West Bank ] This is perhaps the most empty market in the world.","Yes, it is.","It's empty because the settlers living above always throw stuff at us.","Garbage, stones, dirty water, sand, glass, chemicals People have put this net for protection.","Dirty water, urine, rotten eggs and all kinds of garbae and it happens in front of the old military tower.","GIDEON LEVY ISRAELI JOURNALIST.","The first 20 years of Israeli occupation passed without any noteworthy Palestinian reaction.","Israel has never made any political concessions without the shedding of Palestinian blood.","So there was no other option for the Palestinians but to start an uprising. So the first intifada began.","To remind the Israelis this situation couldn't continue.","What other means did the Palestinians have to remind the Israelis of their suffering?","The world forgets the Palestinians. Their means may be terrifying. But it is their only way to remind the Israelis and the entire world of their suffering.","Israelis live a good life in general. They are satisfied with themselves. They think they are right. This is because of the Israeli media.","The media tries to make people satisfied It doesn't want to make them doubt people or let them doubt the Israeli army is the most moral army in the world.","[BEN DROR YEMENI ] [ISRAELI JOURNALIST, MAARIV] Gideon Levy's work makes the world view Israel as a state that commits crimes against humanity.","It is full of lies. I don't support him because he is against peace.","I'm all for peace and co-existence. I don't want to portray the Palestinians as monsters. So don't portray us like that. I want to listen to the Palestinians one day with no prior enmity. Gideon Levy has caused a lot of hatred between us. As an Israeli, I am now hated in the world because of Gideon Levy.","I travel around the world, and give lectures in universities. People always accuse us of being monsters and inhumane. They say that because of what Gideon Levy has written.","[Bilain town] [The West Bank] BILAL AMALI PALESTINIAN CITIZEN.","On 13th November 1993, I went with Jihad and Iyad to visit our friends in Salfit town. It's adjacent to Ariel settlements.","On our way back, a car flashed its lights at us.","We stopped. We didn't know if they were settlers or soldiers. Then they opened fire on our car. I didn't know where the bullets were coming from. Iyad's face was covered in blood. I then heard them coming towards us. I shouted: 'Who are you? What do you want?' They opened my door, pulled me out of the car and started cursing me.","They sarcastically asked me: \"Are you still alive?\"","They threw us on the ground and beat us. They dragged us to this exact spot.","They threatened to hit us with the rifle butt if we moved or said a word. They dragged us from there to here.","They brought Iyad and stripped him of his clothes. I raised my head to see him but they hit me.","Army officers then arrived on the scene. They asked why the soldiers had opened fire on us.","I asked: 'Those were soldiers?'","The officer said: 'Yes. You threatened them.'","I said: 'But We didn't do anything. That is my car.'","The officer then asked how many people lived in my town. I told him about 8,000.","He said: 'Now one of them is dead. So what!' MAHMOUD AMALI FATHER OF IYAD.","I told my wife Iyad had died. She began screaming.","The incident did not end there. The court sentence was issued two years after the incident took place.","The Israeli soldiers who killed him were sentenced to one-hour imprisonment and had to pay a small fine. Our people are killed in cold blood.","In an article entitled 'Stay Silent' on 19th November 1993, Gideon Levy wrote I am standing on the road between Salfit and Iskaka. There are still traces of Iyad's blood. Two days have passed since Iyad's death. The army continues to make the martyr's father suffer by going and coming. 'Come back after two hours.' 'Come back tomorrow.' 'Bring a police permit.' 'Bring a permit from the civil administration.' 'Everything will be OK.' All the time, his son's corpse remains in the morgue. Minister Shochat and Abu Alaa are currently in Paris discussing economic measures. Meanwhile, 5 Palestinians were killed this month at checkpoints in the occupied territories.\"","[Levy] There should be a new intifada. To remind the world and the Israelis there is a problem. I'd completely understand the Palestinians if they started an intifada. Israel has left them with no other option.","I can't imagine what the Israelis would do if they were under such an occupation. The Palestinians have got nothing without fighting for it. They must fight.","\"Gideon Levy. You are welcomed by the enemy because of your limitless support to him and your hate-filled views towards Israel.\"","\"Gideon. You are the perfect mouthpiece for Nazism which is spreading nowadays more than ever.\"","\"It is enough for someone to read Gideon Levy's English articles to understand why the world hates us.\"","Levy I write what I believe. I don't change any of what I see on the ground. If the truth is radical, then my writings will be radical as well.","I think reality is radical. It's a very brutal occupation that has existed for many years. A radical reality. The reaction to that can only be radical too. I sometimes like to enrage the Israelis. I'll continue to write like that. Maybe they will wake up one day.","BASSEM EID HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST.","Levy has been visiting the occupied territories for 22 years. He has risked his life several times there. He deserves to be a Palestinian negotiator, not an Israeli journalist. Unfortunately, Levy's articles have not affected the Arab media. Arabs should support Gideon Levy. The Arab League should invite Levy to deliver a speech in front of Arab ambassadors to Cairo. To reveal Israel's violations.","One day, we can tell Israel: \"Here, an Israeli journalist wrote that you did such and such to the Palestinians\". Why can't he get the attention of the Arab media?","[Bil'in town] [The West Bank ] [Bilain town] [The West Bank ] [Bassem] We are in Bil'in village.","We will visit the home of Palestinian martyr Jawaher Abu Rahmeh who was killed on 1st January 2011.","Her family have lived through tragedy as her brother was killed 20 months earlier.","I told Gideon Levy about this family. We came here, investigated the incident and the story was published in Haaretz.","SALEEMAH ABU RAHMEH MOTHER OF TWO MARTYRS.","Bassem was killed in 2009. He was marching in a protest. Israeli soldiers shot him twice. He was fatally wounded in the chest.","They took this out of his chest.","Jawaher was killed on 1st January 2011. It was a Friday morning. She wanted to watch the protest outside.","We stood here. She wanted to join the protest, but I refused.","I told her: 'Look at the soldiers, all over the place. Among the houses, among the olive trees.'","They were firing grenades everywhere. We couldn't see anything. She inhaled a lot of gas. She went there and got shot. She fell over. Her mouth was foaming.","We didn't expect that.","The doctors told us she had died.","May God's mercy be with her.","The doctors didn't let me see Jawaher. I went back home. There were a lot of people there. I told them not to cry. She is a martyr. I tried to hold myself together. I prayed. First I had lost Bassem, and then Jawaher. I can do nothing but pray to God. Commenting on this incident, Gideon Levy wrote an article entitled \"Lies of the Israeli Army\" on the 9th January 2011. \"The Israeli army issued several untruths about Jawaher's death. They first said she had died from natural causes at home, not in the hospital. But that didn't work. Then they came up with other lies. They said she wasn't with the protesters. They also claimed Jawaher was ill with cancer. It's all lies!\"","[Levy] This place was born from a sin that created a lot of injustice. The state of Israel.","Immigrants came here and caused a lot of injustice.","The problem is that this injustice did not end in 1948. The 1967 occupation is a direct continuity of the 1948 injustice.","Rather than apologising for what we did in 1948 rather than admitting the injustice against the Palestinians we caused we continue to practise this injustice to this day.","[Zleikha] That's the door of my house. I am not allowed to use it. Gideon Levy, who is visiting me for the first time, can open it and go out, but I can't.","Sometimes when I'm cleaning my house, I open the door to let the water out.

Several times settlers have tried to enter my house from the balcony.","Every time I come out here on the balcony, settlers curse me and my religion. They say abusive words about the Prophet Muhammad.","They throw stones and make fun of us standing behind this iron mesh. They say we are like monkeys.","Of course we can't answer them back. If we do, the army would immediately storm our house.","Levy: What will make you leave this place?","Zleikha: What will make me leave this place? Death.","[Bassem] I don't accompany Levy as often as before.","A young man killed in Qalandiya A house demolished in Silwan Olive trees cut in Snijel A young man killed in Dheisheh A house demolished in Tulkarem I've witnessed this litany of violations and crimes for 24 years.

He didn't bat an eyelid.","What did he mean? Perhaps what killed the family was not a missile fired by the air force? Perhaps it was a falling star! The pilot who pressed the button and fired a missile at a crowded street in Gaza also did so without batting an eyelid. His aim was to kill Islamic Jihad leader Muhammad Dahdouh. But along with him, he killed an entire family. A grandmother, a mother and her son. Two other members of the family were seriously injured: the father and three-year old Maria.\"","[Hamdy] I was surprised when I saw Gideon visiting us. Why would an Israeli visit me in my home and pay condolences! We both cried together. He promised he would get us in a fully-equipped Israeli hospital after one week. Of course such equipment is not available in Gaza. And he kept his promise. It all happened because of his article.","[Levy] People live a good life in a bubble.","They don't want to acknowledge reality During the recent Israeli war on Gaza, the beaches here were packed while Apache helicopters flew overhead on bombing missions to Gaza.","Life went on here.

We knew there was no point in going to court.","As in two weeks' time, they would have destroyed everything. We formed the first popular committee.","It included representatives of every political party, council, club, society and family.","We first demonstrated on 9th November 2003.","We were 110 Palestinian protesters.","At that time, there were no Israeli or international supporters.","[9/11/2003] [Ayed] They fired live and rubber bullets and tear gas at us.

What we want is their freedom and their ability to live freely and with self determination.","[Jonathan Pollak] [Speaking English] I guess the soldiers like the vast majorities of Israelis society sees the people who come here, Israelis who come here as traitors, and to a degree I think, they are right, because we betray the notion that this place here is part of Israel, that Israelis are better than Palestinians, that Israelis deserve more rights and better security that Palestinians here, than Palestinians inside Israel, than refugees.","So to that degree, they are correct, we are traitors and I'm very proud to portray this culture [Amireh] Five were killed in less than one year.","Between 29th July 2008 and 5th June 2009.","Many women had miscarriages because of inhaling the tear gas.","A five-month-old baby once died due to suffocation from tear gas.","[Amireh] Around 31 people were injured by live bullets.","At least 800 were injured by rubber bullets.","Thousands suffered from tear gas suffocation.","About 17 houses were either partially or completely burned.","At least 450 olive trees were set on fire.

So Ashraf at the duration of the protest, sit on the hillside looking at the action, there was some stone throwing and in the end of the protests some Jeeps come in and Ashraf went up to them there was some verbals or whatever was arrested.

After the 1967 war, Aqaba was declared a closed military zone with three military training camps.","The Israeli training exercises caused about 50 casualties.","This led to a Palestinian exodus to neighbouring villages.","24 kilometres from Aqaba is Kafr Qaddum. The Israeli settlement of Kadoumim sits alongside - and blocks one of the roads into the Palestinian village.","The residents are campaigning against both the settlement and the road block led by Murad Eshtawi.","[Kafr Qaddum village, North of the West Bank] MURAD ESHTEWI POPULAR COMMITTEE OF KAFR QADDUM. Kafr Qaddum is a 2,400 hectare Palestinian village of agricultural land. The village technically belongs to Qalqilya province. Kafr Qaddum's suffering started with the Israeli occupation in 1967. Since then our difficulties have increased. The Israelis seized our land and built settlements, mainly Kadoumim in 1978. More land was taken by force after that.","Today there are five Israeli compounds on 400 hectares around Kafr Qaddum. Suffering reached its height in 2003, during the second Intifada. The Israeli army then decided to close the only road leading to the village. The residents still can't access their land on foot or by car.","Al Maleh has suffered from the Israeli appropriation of property for military training.","AREF DARAGMEH HEAD OF AL-MALEH VILLAGE COUNCIL. Al Maleh was made up of 13 small villages. It was completely wiped out by the Israelis in 1967.","The residents were scattered throughout Palestine and the rest of the world.","Some came back and set up camps here in the northern Palestinian valley, north west of Tubas.","All of this is considered to be Area C according to the Oslo Accords. Life is very difficult for the Palestinians.","More than 60% of Palestinian land in this area has been closed by Israel. This year the Israeli army started a new policy. They're forcing out the Palestinians from their tents and camps. They plan to extend military training on our land.","[Birzeit University, West Bank] Very many Palestinians and some Israelis believe that the Oslo Accords and the division of the West Bank were a raw deal for the PLO - and that they have served the Palestinians very badly.","DR. HUSSEIN AL-RIMMAWI BIRZEIT UNIVERSITY, WEST BANK.","The Oslo Accords divided the West Bank into geographical areas. In my opinion, this was the biggest mistake.","The West Bank was divided into Areas A, B and C. At the start, Area A was 3% of the West Bank. It increased to 18% by 1999.","The Palestinian Authority has full control of Area A. Area B represents about 21% of the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority is in charge of the health, education, health, and the economy while Israel controls the security sector.","Area C constitutes a real disaster. It represents 61% of the West Bank. Most of the Israeli settlements have been built in Area C. It's under full Israeli control, particularly security. Palestinians have no authority over this.","DROR ETKES ISRAELI RESEARCHER & CAMPAIGNER. Area C (61% of the west bank) had been targeted by the Israeli authorities. As the area where the Israeli military and civilian present should be expanding to in order to eliminate the possibility that these areas will one day become part of a Palestinian state, and basically to intensify the dissection of west bank to different parts which in between there are always areas C and making sure that Palestinians cannot freely use the land and cannot also freely move.","DR. JAWAD AL-HAMAD MIDDLE EAST STUDIES CENTER, JORDAN. The Oslo Accords set out the division of the West Bank into Areas A, B and C. The 1995 Taba agreement reinforced this division. To move between the three Areas, you have to go through Israeli checkpoints. Palestinians are delayed and humiliated at these checkpoints.","[Murad Eshtewi] Israel wants to take over the land on both sides of the main road. Here lies the real danger. It's considered to be Area C according to the Oslo Accords. The Israelis haven't just closed the road for supposed security concerns. They aim to extend the Kadumim settlement by stealing Palestinians farmers' land.","[Dror Etkes] [Researcher and activist against the Israeli occupation] I would say generally that the West Bank has become a jungle or if you wish a haven for construction criminals, people who feel like taking the land of the neighbour just have to wake up one day with enough energy and decide to grab the land of the neighbour. In most cases, if you're stubborn enough this is what will happen eventually and the Israeli authorities will eventually back them. If the state of Israel will enforce law as it should, I mean at the end of the day this is what a state supposed to do noto enforce law, if the Israeli state will force law on Israeli settlers living them, that means much less land would be available.","[Aqaba village, North of the West Bank] [Sami Sadek] I was hit by 3 bullets in 1971 during a military training exercise in Aqaba. I'm now partially disabled. I still have a bullet near my heart.","[Aqaba village ] [Sami Sadek] There's gunfire day and night in Aqaba. Rockets are launched mainly from above Aqaba. Shrapnel spreads across the village and endangers life. Israeli forces threaten everyday to wipe out our village every day.","They continuously tell us to leave for Yacine village but we refuse to leave [Murad Eshtewi] The residential part of Kafr Qaddum is in Area B.","The rest of the village is in Area C. Any expansion of the Palestinian village is prohibited. These restrictions are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land.","[Aref Daraghmeh] 350 dwellings, including tents and animal sheds were dismantled between 2012 and 2013. More than 1,300 other dwellings are threatened by demolition. Demolition and eviction notices are being served every day. Lands seizure is a daily occurrence here.","[Amateur Video] [Sami Sadek] About 300 people are now left in Aqaba. 700 have been forced into neighbouring villages. 95% of buildings and roads are threatened by demolition or closure. Over 25% cases are now before the Israeli Supreme Court. There are some provisional orders to stop the demolition. But the whole village is still threatened by demolition. For the Israelis, it's a closed military area.","[Sami Sadek] We organise our meetings under this carob tree. We've never been allowed to build a seat for our village council. We've been running the village from under this tree since 1998. We are trying to get people who've left back to the village. We have the deeds of ownership of this land.","[Sami Sadek] People should move from Areas A and B to Area C. They should return to protect their own property. If we lose the Jordan valley and Aqaba, we'll lose the West Bank and Nablus.","Israeli occupation and control unites every Palestinian community but each faces its own individual, local problems.","[Murad Eshtewi] What's most dangerous is not the closure of the road but this Israeli settlement built on 400 hectares of our village. Its municipality refuses to put up a security fence like the other settlements. That's what frightens us. For them, the settlement has no boundaries.","The Palestinians can't access this land without security coordination with the Israelis. Permission is granted once or twice a year. We have a difficult job on our hands. We have to continue our resistance to get the road re-opened. But what's most important is to preserve the 300 hectares threatened with confiscation. The Israelis are trying to expand the settlement at the expense of Palestinians landowners.","Murad Eshtawi's fight is up-hill and his cause a passionate one.","Palestinians want their own state. But some Israelis have very different ideas about the future of the West Bank.","MORDECHAI KEDAR BAR-LLAN UNIVERSITY, TEL AVIV. The real solution which can work on the ground is the Palestinian emirates. We already have one Palestinian emirate in Gaza, it has borders, it has government, it has whatever a state needs. We should establish another 7 states/ emirates on the West Bank. One in Jericho for the Arikat tribe or clan One in Ramallah. One in the Arab part of Hebron. Another one in Nablus and so forth in Jenin ,Tulkarm and Qalqilya.","Israel should forever remain in the rural areas, in order to make sure that those mountains would never turn into Hamas mountains. The Arab societies over all the Middle East, are very much tribal societies. They live in the same place, they don't move from place to place generally. People are more loyal to their clan, to their tribe more than they are loyal to the state. This will free them from Israel, yet Israel will be secure because Israel will be in the rural areas between the cities. This is the architecture. We have to solve some problems of water supply of sewage, roads, accessibility to airports and seaports. All these questions can be solved by peace. [Dr.Jawad Al-Hamad] [Head of Middle East Studies Centre, Jordan] Some Israeli intellectuals say there's no need for a Palestinian state. They want the creation of political enclaves in each town and province. Some extremists call these Islamic or tribal emirates. They're living in the Stone Age. It would be like apartheid in the old South Africa.","Unfortunately, the possibility of a future Palestinian state is undermined it's division into Areas A, B and C. Natural resources are also a vital factor in the future of the Area C. [DR Hussein Al-Rimmawi ] [Professor of political geography, Birzeit University] Area C includes semi-coastal zones like Tul Karam and Qalqilya, mountain zones in central Palestine's Jerusalem, Nablus and Hebron as well as valley zones. Part of the Jordan Valley is considered to be in Area C. It's very rich in natural resources like woodland. There are also areas of pasture that connect Palestinian towns . Oil and gas were recently discovered in Area C and elsewhere in Palestine. The West Bank is rich in underground water. There are three reservoirs in the east, south and west.","The most controversial resource of all in Area C is water.","DR. ABDUL RAHMAN AL-TAMIMI ASSOCIATION OF PALESTINIAN HYDROLOGISTS.","The Oslo Accords didn't divide water into Areas A, B and C. Israel has the upper hand over water.","All the water resources that supply the towns and villages are in Area C. There are some wells in area A but they are no good.","80% of the wells are in Area C. The Palestinian Authority has to consult Israel on everything to do with water, even in Areas A and B. MAHMOUD ABU ZAFER FARMER, FALAMYEH, HEBRON.","Three months ago a group of soldiers came here with some civilians. They worked for the Israel water authority. One of them entered the well. Then he asked me to open the water metre. He said my metre wasn't accurate. I asked him why.","He said: 'You're stealing water. ' 'This is illegal. You will be punished. He told me aggressively to put in a new metre and limit consumption. How can I do that?","[AREF DARAGMEH] [HEAD OF AL-MALEH VILLAGE COUNCIL] Water is the most sensitive issue here. Israel drained the springs and appropriated the water. Israel supplies its military camps and settlements with our water. Palestinians have to bring water from the northern Jordan valley and Tamoon, which are 50 kilometres away. One cubic meter costs us more than 15 dollars.","[Dr Abdul Rahman Al-Tamimi] An Israeli settler consumes around 600 cubic metres a year while a Palestinian consumes only 140 for farming and drinking. What's strange is that we pay four times the price. Our conditions were much better before the Oslo Accords.","ALUN McDONALD MEDIA OFFICER, OXFAM INTERNATIONAL. Palestinian's have very little access to water and other resources and they are often prevented from accessing some of their most fertile land. In comparison to this, a few 100 meters away sometimes you have Israeli settlements, which continue to expand where new buildings are frequently announced and which have access to 80% of water resources. So you have a very discriminatory system, where some people are allowed to build and some people are not.","[Dr. Abdul Rahman Al-Tamimi] If things don't change, Palestinians will not only face thirst, but will die of hunger. Agriculture will completely disappear. The Jordan Valley, Qalqilya, and Jenin are known as the bread basket of Palestine. This basket will be empty in the next 10 to 15 years. That's what Israel wants. There's no point in hoping otherwise.","The danger for Palestinians of their natural resources being gradually squeezed is a real one and so are the appropriation of heritage sites, the forced destruction of newly built homes and the continued control of Area C by an occupying force, seemingly un-checked by the international community.","The 1993 Oslo Accords divided the West Bank of Jordan into Areas A, B and C. Area C was supposed gradually to pass to Palestinian control but still remains firmly in Israeli hands. Palestinians now see an increasing threat to their essential supplies of food and water. Mahmoud Abu Zafer, Farmer, Falamyeh village, Hebron.","We are given a specific amount of water. Exceeding that limit results in a fine. My well would also be closed though it's on my land. We have to ask permission for the smallest of details.","[DR. Abdul Rahman Al-Tamimi] The Israelis consider the West Bank water reserves as their own. They disregard the Palestinians living there.","Palestinians are now customers forced to buy water from Israeli desalination plants. To them we are customers not citizens.","Within 10 years, the Palestinian Authority won't be able to supply food and water for Palestinians.","Palestinians also feel that Israel has found another way of limiting their use of the land.","[D. Hussein Al-Rimmawi] [Professor of political geography, Birzeit University] Israel has built what they call nature reserves in the West Bank. These nature reserves constitute 14% of Area C and 3% of the West Bank. Some areas are agricultural, like the Qana valley but Israel calls them natural reserves. This way Israel prevents Palestinians from using their own lands.","Local Palestinian farmers have worked this land for generations.","KHADER MANSOUR FARMER, QANA VALLEY.","I was born here in Qana Valley. My grandfather died here, aged 85. My father also died here, aged 80. I'm now 85 and I want to die in this valley. The Israelis put up a sign declaring this valley a nature reserve. We didn't know what it meant at the time but we're not allowed to farm here. This area belongs to my cousin. Whenever we plant here the Israelis destroy it. But we won't give up.","Five years ago, a demonstration was organised by the Palestinians in Qana valley. I asked the Israeli forces to clear the road for us but they wanted us to withdraw. I had a row with them and they told me to put my hands up. Instead I threw stones at them. I was handcuffed and put on the ground by four soldiers.","[Khader Mansour] They build settlements but prevent us from building houses on our land. Israelis keep coming and going on their motorbikes, but we're not allowed to use the road. A settler told me this water source is the property of the Israel and if I increase water consumption I'll be fined. I told him this was our land and not Israel's. This nature reserve is Palestinian. I do't recognise Israel.","Area C also contains Palestinian heritage sites dating back to Biblical times.","OSAMA AL AISSA PALESTINIAN NOVELIST & HISTORIAN.","Mount Herodion is in Area C, east of Bethlehem.","It once belonged to Herod the Great, ruler of the Roman province of Palestine. Herodion has been of great importance in the history of Palestine over 2,000 years We do not have statistics about Palestinian archaeological sites. The Israel Antiquities Authority says there are between 20,000 to 25,000 sites in what used to be Palestine under British Mandate. For us, Palestine is the land between the Mediterranean and the River Jordan.","We do not have complete statistics for the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. These territories have an estimated 35 important monastic sites. They date back to the Byzantine era.","Palestinian negotiators didn't rely on maps in identifying Palestinian archaeological sites. They trusted the so-called Israelis good intentions. Many Palestinian sites were identified as Jewish, like Khirbet Susya.","It's a Byzantine site and Muslims later lived in it and built a mosque. Palestinians were expelled from this area. The site was then handed over to the Israeli settlers. Susya village is one example of Israel's seizure of Palestinian archaeological sites.","In 1969, an ancient synagogue was discovered at Susiya attracting Israeli tourists to the disputed site.","Salam, and welcome to the ancient town of Susya. You are standing at the entrance to the town. Susya is located in the southern Hebron hills on the northern border. NASER ALNOAJHA RESIDENT, SUSIYA VILLAGE.","Susiya was declared Israeli in 1986. Israel then built a wall and forced people out of the village. Those expelled were hoping they'd come back to Susiya one day. The Israelis then looted everything and claimed it as Jewish. All Palestinian items like the traditional plough and dairy utensils were looted.","Today the Israeli display them in exhibitions and call them Jewish. [Naser Alnoajha] The Israelis looted and destroyed Palestinian archaeological sites. This had never happened before. Our cultural heritage is not just for Palestinians, it's universal. Osama Al aissa Palestinian novelist and historian.","As part of their political agenda, the Israelis are building settlements and destroying our archaeological sites. These sites date back to the time of Jesus Christ. But Israel is bulldozing land and changing the landscape of Palestine [DROR ETKES ISRAELI ] In the West Bank today, there are around 560,000 Israeli's living , around 200 thousand of them are in East Jerusalem in the areas which Israel has annexed to Jerusalem and to Israel. The rest 360 to 365,000 are in the rest of the West Bank in the areas which were not annexed officially to Israel. The Israeli settlers who are living in areas beyond East Jerusalem, are residing in 121 Israeli official settlements. Plus, another 100 unofficial settlements which usually are being referred to as the outposts. So, we have 220 or so civilian entities where these 365,000 Israeli's are residing. If we look at what happened here in the West Bank in terms of Oslo, 20 years, in 1993 there were 110,000 Israeli's living in West Bank.","Dror Etkes is an Israeli opposed to the settlements in the West Bank.","His research reflects the experience of Palestinians living at the sharp end of Israeli occupation in Area C. [Naser Alnoajha] [Resident of the Susiya village] The Susya site sits between the original Palestinian village, and Israeli settlement, which is named after it. Israel forced Palestinians out and took control over their land. It often serves demolition notices in Susiya. Some have been carried out. Military law is tough on the Palestinians.","Anything higher than one metre high from the ground is considered illegal and is demolished , even if it's a dog kennel [Naser Alnoajha] I believe the Oslo Accords were a trap. Palestinians in Susiya have to get building consent from the Israeli Authorities. Former PM Dr. Salam Fayyad built six housing units in Susiya. But, Israel soon demolished them, every Palestinian investment in the land is sabotaged.","DR. SALAM FAYYAD FMR PM, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. The land known as Area C was an integral part of Palestine but was occupied by Israel in 1967. The land known as Area C was an integral part of Palestine. Accepting the Oslo Accords at face value is not to our advantage. Palestinians have to hold onto their lands and survive on their own. This means not accepting the occupation but confronting it.","[Alun McDonald] Across the West bank, there are currently four and a half thousand demolition notice still outstanding against Palestinian property. In July 2013, the new round of peace talks began between Israel and the Palestinian authority and in the first three months after this peace talk started Israeli demolished another 150 or so Palestinian structures, some of them funded with international aid money. And that made over 200 people including many children homeless.","[DR. SALAM FAYYAD] [FMR PM, PALESTINIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY] Between 2007 and 2013, some 2,800 civic projects were implemented throughout the occupied Palestinian territories. About 800 projects were in Area C. Dozens of projects were even behind the wall, separating Israel from the occupied territories. The cost of all these was around a billion dollars of which 320 million were spent in Area C. Most were soon demolished by occupation forces. But we never give up and sometimes we've succeeded in re-building after Israeli demolition.","[ALUN McDONALD] [MEDIA OFFICER, OXFAM INTERNATIONAL] This village like many is suffering from a lack of any kind of basic services, any kind of infrastructural development. Many of the homes, many of the structures are at the risk of demolition. This is something that Palestinian villages across area C face as a daily threat. It's incredibly frustrating to be in communities that need support, they need development, they need infrastructure. And the policies of the occupation prevent them from doing that themselves and yet when international aid comes to help its often demolished or prevented. Between the middle of 2012 to middle of 2013 there were about 30 projects funded by the European Union that were demolished to the cost of 100,000 if not millions of euros.","[AREF DARAGMEH] [HEAD OF AL-MALEH VILLAGE COUNCIL] Three or four years ago, Palestinian children had to walk 10 km to school either on foot or by donkey. Then we managed to get buses. But that didn't help relieve their suffering and anxiety caused by the Israeli occupation. School children living by candle light in the desert would go to school by donkey, and come home to find their tents demolished and school books bulldozed.","[Aref Daraghmeh] Education is one of our priorities. Despite the demolition notices we've built this makeshift school. Though it's a makeshift school, Israel has ordered its demolition, along with other dwellings in Susya.","Sometimes the aid agencies are best placed to bring events on the ground in Area C to the attention of the wider world.","[Alun McDonald] What we'd like to see the international community take a stronger line against that and really when a project is demolished, which costs the European tax payer for example, we would like to see EU governments hold Israel accountable for that demolition and call for compensation for example for the money that has just been lost and also ensure that families who have had their homes demolished are compensated and properly relocated as a result.","[Dr. Salam Fayyad ] Due to increased international awareness of Area C the World Bank did a study on the economic impact of occupation on Palestinians but Israel's restrictions on Area C damaged it. Palestine's need for foreign aid would drop by 800 million dollars if Israel lifted those restrictions.","We're losing around 200,000 jobs opportunities because we're denied the right to work in Area C. Israel's influential broadsheet and online newspaper, the Jerusalem Post, supports Salam Fayed's view that Israel is holding back the Palestinian economy.","[DR. JAWAD AL-HAMAD] [HEAD OF MIDDLE EAST STUDIES, JORDAN] The world bank devised many strategies for developing countries. But none of them has really benefited from this advice. The economies of Arab countries dealing with the World Bank have been receded. Our battle now is to end the Occupation and the Palestinian suffering. Palestinians can develop their economy only when the Israelis withdraw from the West Bank. [Aref Daraghmeh] The Oslo Accords were imposed to enable Israel to take over the Jordan Valley. As a Palestinian living here, that is 'C' and my house is 'C'. May be my children will be called C .","[Aref Daraghmeh] We have official papers proving our legitimate ownership of more than 90 per cent of these areas. Where would I go? I have no other homeland. The Palestinians don't want to live through second Nakba. Peace negotiations have stopped and started since the Oslo Accords; but the positions of both sides over Area C remain as intractable as ever.

The picture of Askalan jail lives inside of me.","[Therese Halaseh ] Those who have been in prison should undergo medical tests and rehabilitation on leaving. Especially since many detainees were young. It's not much to ask for. But we need someone to make us understand how the society has changed.","[Anwar Yaseen ] The nightmares are fewer now. The bad experience no longer affects us. I did my best to free myself from the past. I view it as a period of time that has passed. I need to be reconciled with my past.","I had difficulties at that time. But I also benefitted from them. I developed a strong character to face the prison guards and the harsh conditions.

From the dawn of Christianity the early centuries AD were associated with Persecution. The first persecution led to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In essence, Christianity supersedes Judaism. From the very beginning the Jews were hostile towards the early Christian. It was physical abuse rather than psychological. Many who converted to Christianity were killed and martyrdom was very common in the early centuries AD.As a result, Christians hid and prayed in catacombs or cemeteries. In that early period of persecution, several figures emerged. One of them was Father Origen. He was a remarkable scholar in the history of the church. He was born into a Christian family in Alexandria in 185 AD. He had a thirst for learning and a loving spirit. His fame spread throughout the world. Origen lived a temperate life as a hermit. He visited the Holy Land and settled here.

Israel only issues permits to Christians for religious holidays. But it claims to the world to be 'open' by allowing some Christians to visit sacred sites. However they generally only issue a permit to one family member and ignore the rest.","At a religious festival, no one wants to pray and celebrate alone leaving their family behind.","[ARCHBISHOP ATALLAH HANNAH] ARCHBISHOP OF SEBASTIA, ORTHODOX CHURCH The Palestinians, Christian or Muslim are deprived of visiting holy sites in Jerusalem. When I visit Bethlehem, Beit Jala or other Palestinian cities young people tell me they've never seen Jerusalem. So before we discuss overseas visitors, our priority must be Palestinians, the original people of this land. [MILATIOS BASAL] Pilgrims are either locals or foreigners. Visitors come from Russia, Romania, Italy and so on.","REV.","STEPHEN SIZER CHRISTIAN WRITER & COMMENTATOR.","Since 1967 the Israeli ministry of tourism has really exploited the Palestinian territories for their historic and archaeological locations and significance in the bible and so the Israeli Ministry of tourism produces maps which don't show the international borders don't show the green line will show the Golan as part of Israel and West bank as part of Israel.","[STEPHEN SIZER] The Israeli government clearly has an agenda to portray an Israeli script of the holy land. They will visit historical sites associated with the conquest of Palestine by the Israelites and perhaps a few locations that will help re-enforce Israel's insecurity or its need for the land that has been stolen from the Palestinians When you go to somewhere like Yad Vashem for example an Israeli guide will say, look what the Germans did to the Jewish people, now you understand why we need security. And often a visit to Yad Vashem will take place on the first day of the tour so that the group is traumatized and will be silenced from criticising Israel.","[ATALLAH HANNA] The Israeli Tourism Ministry tries to prevent contact between pilgrims and Palestinian figures. They do this because they don't want the Palestinian Christian point-of-view to be heard about the situation in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories.","[STEPHEN SIZER] I remember the first time I visited Israel/Palestine, I was quite nervous because of the stories I'd heard about the Palestinians. Our first guide was an Israeli, messianic Jew. On one occasion we were on the Via Delarosa, and we stopped for a few moments. People were asking him questions: can you please tell me what a Palestinian is. And he gave us all a little piece of paper that has been clearly prepared for such an occasion on which he was quoting Golda Meir saying that Palestinians do not exist, they are Arabs and they can live somewhere else. A couple of days later we were in Nazareth and we met an Anglican cleric named Riyah Abu El-Assal and here we had our host introducing himself as a Palestinian Arab Christian. REV. RIYAH ABU EL-ASSAL ANGLICAN BISHOP OF JERUSALEM 19982007.","I fear for the Holy Land not because there are fewer pilgrims now, on the contrary, but if the majority of Arab Christians emigrate. The land will be a museum of holy stones without genuine value. What's the value of a sacred site without its blessed inhabitants visiting it to pray and preserve it?","[STEPHEN SIZER] Pilgrimage groups that visit Israel/Palestine, the vast majority follow a very pre-determined itinerary. They will go to West Jerusalem, stay in West Jerusalem. They will visit the western wall, Yad Versham, they will go to a Kibbutz, they'll go the Sea of Galilee. They might go to Bethlehem. They probably won't go to Jericho. They definitely don't go to Nablus.","Sabastiyya, a major Roman city in Palestine, is not included in any of the Christian pilgrimages arranged by Israeli tourist companies. This is despite the fact that some Christian sources say that John the Baptist was buried here.","This is St George's, one of the very oldest churches in the world, at Burqin near Jenin in the West Bank. It's thought to mark the place where Jesus healed the ten lepers in Luke's Gospel. St. George's Church is not, however, included in any organised Christian pilgrimage tour.","[FADI QATTAN] The Lepers' Church in Burqin and Jacob's Well in Nablus are in the Palestinian territories. They remain underdeveloped. Israeli tourist agencies ignore these places because they're now behind the separation wall now. Pilgrimage can't be partitioned. It has to be respected, rich and complete. Israeli tour operators look to make money and neglect the major pilgrimage landmarks.","Some Israeli pilgrimage tours include three days in the Red Sea resort of Eilat. It's not of any value to a Christian pilgrim but is a four-hour drive south of Jerusalem making it a five-day trip.","Most pilgrims spend 10-12 days in the Holy Land. If they waste three nights in Eilat, plus two days travel, what do they miss, as a result? [STEPHEN SIZER] Sadly I've seen pilgrimages that offer an opportunity to visit a settlement near Hebron where you can for the day you can pretend to be a member of the IDF, and you engage in mock conflict where they've built a little Palestinian village and you can go in and take out terrorists. This kind of commercial militaristic element of tourism is very worrying because it perpetuates this notion that the Palestinians are the enemy rather than our brothers and sisters. The pilgrimage routes differ from one Christian denomination to another. This map shows the itinerary of most pre-arranged pilgrimage tours today. They exclude the north of the West Bank. The harsh reality of life in, for example, Jesus' birthplace, Bethlehem, is very different from its traditional, biblical image.","[FADI QATTAN] The 2001 invasion of Bethlehem was probably one of the toughest times for the city.Occupation forces invaded, imposed a curfew and sieged the Church of the Nativity with people hiding inside. The siege was humiliating for such a sacred place. They fired live ammunition at the Church and priests trapped inside had their rooms shot at and windows broken. The church bell-ringer was up the tower trying to ring the bells when an Israeli sniper killed him, making him a martyr.","[FADI QATTAN] After the siege ended and things went back to normal. The tourist bus would reach the Bethlehem checkpoint and the Israelis would claim there was a security hazard. The pilgrims were forced to go back to Jerusalem even though nothing was going on in Bethlehem.","Most tourists spend a very short time there 45 minutes to two hours. Bethlehem reaps no economic benefits.","Worse still, the pilgrims are told to be afraid of the locals and have no opportunity to break this barrier and interact with native Palestinians.","[FADI QATTAN] We're now in Cremisan Valley in Beit Jala. There are two monasteries here, one for monks and the other for nuns.","The area is surrounded by two settlements, Gilo and Har Gilo.","The Israelis plan to build a separation wall on land owned by the Church and local Palestinians as well as separating the two monasteries. Celebrating holy mass was started by the locals from Beit Jala, Bethlehem and Beit Sahour. Today, both Muslims and Christians take part in the mass. It takes place every Friday afternoon. We know how to demand our rights peacefully in the face of the occupation, which is not peaceful. [FADI QATTAN] My office is in the centre of Bethlehem, downstairs from my home. I realise I'm living a contradiction. One the one hand, I'm trying to keep contacts with agents abroad to send me pilgrims to Bethlehem.","But I can also see that no one really cares about us. We've witnessed Bethlehem being destroyed and its infrastructure being destroyed every day. We're changing this in the tourism sector. We travel to foreign exhibitions and meet travel agents. We help pilgrims to affiliate with local churches and communities here. We arrange scout gatherings and meetings with the city mayor. Israeli travel agents don't do this.","On their tours, the pilgrims only spend about 45 minutes in Bethlehem. We help the pilgrims to enjoy a spiritually complete experience.","DR. MOHAMMAD WAHEEB JORDANIAN ARCHEOLOGIST. Father Origen tried hard to identify the place where Jesus was baptised. He called it Bethabara. The Baptism of Jesus is recorded in three of the Gospels and is central to Christian belief. Sources vary as to its location but in what survives of the writings of Origen of Alexandria, he talks about a site 8 kilometres north of the Dead Sea.","[MOHAMMAD WAHEEB] The Madaba Mosaic map was crucial in determining the baptism site.The map goes back to the 5th and 6th centuries AD.","On it we can see Origen's Bethabara near Jericho on the western side of the river Jordan. The map also has a second site called Ainon- Saphsaphas in Greek which we believe is Bethany Beyond The Jordan, mentioned in the Bible, on the east side of the River Jordan. [MILATIOS BASAL] We can't be precise about the real baptism site but we know it was near Jericho. Until the 1980s, the Israelis tried to overshadow the original baptism site in the media. They came up with a small place near the Sea of Galilee called Yardenit.","In fact, Yardenit has no biblical or historical connection with the baptism of Jesus. It was just a tourist spot and a financially lucrative one.","Then In the late 1990s, Jordan started to show interest in the baptism site. They wanted to revive Jordan as part of the Holy Land and started excavating it with historians and archaeologists. A team of Jordanian archaeologists led by Dr. Mohammed Waheeb, excavated for 3 years to try to identify the exact location of Jesus' baptism.","Jordan announced the official opening of its Baptism site in the 2000.","\"Palace of the Jews\" is one of the three main Christian holy sites. It'll be opened in two days and entry is free. The Vatican's recognition of the Jordanian Baptism Site, along with other churches, caused Israel to establish a different site, only a few meters away.","However, Israel still continues only to promote its own, alternative site near the Sea of Galilee. [MILATIOS BASAL] The Israelis finally decided to change things. They initially kept the place closed to Christian pilgrims to fit their religious agenda.","The Old Testament says it's the place where Joshua crossed the dead sea holding the arc of the covenant. But they wanted to erase any Christian link with the place and turn It into a Synagogue. They even call it the Palace of the Jews.","The foreign pilgrim guides are told to liaise with the army to visit the baptism site.","I find this outrageous, considering the site is part of the West Bank and is classified a Palestinian area under the Oslo Accords. Yet the Israeli army controls the land and prohibits Palestinians with green IDs from entering. It's shameful to block a pilgrimage site.","The Gospels of Luke and Matthew refer to Nazareth as Jesus' childhood home.","The second century theologian, Father Origen of Alexandria, is reputed to have searched for the village but he was unable to find such a small village.","Today, Nazareth is the capital of Galilee with a population of over 80,000 predominantly Arab.","[STEPHEN SIZER] Nazareth is a very interesting, could be a very interesting case study for tourism in Israel Palestine, because it is in Israel but is largely an Arab city.","SUHEIL DIAB FORMER SPOKESMAN, NAZARETH MUNICIPALITY. Nazareth is a nuisance for the Israeli government. They can't erase its existence. They couldn't do it after Al Nakba in 1948 for International and historical reasons. On the other hand, they want to reduce the city's status. In 1956, they established a big Jewish city, which they later called Nazaret Illit to marginalise the Palestinian city of Nazareth and make it a small district of the extended Jewish city. They aim to turn Nazareth into a very quick pilgrimage visit.","[STEPHEN SIZER] So you visit Nazareth you park down on the main road, you walk quite quickly up to the Church of Annunciation so there is little or no opportunity even to shop, let alone engage with the local Christians.","The Israelis would want hotel, tour groups to stay in Tiberius or Nazareth and it is deeply detrimental to the local economy. [SUHEIL DIAB] The Israeli government couldn't object to the Pope's visit in 2009 but it was crucial to the visit plan. To be clear, successive Israeli governments have viewed Papal visits unfavourably because these visits highlight the non-Jewish history of this land. They can't prevent the visits, but they want to minimise the roles of Nazareth, and of Arabic Jerusalem and of Bethlehem in such visits. In 2009, The Israeli government proposed that the main Papal Mass of Pope Benedict the Sixteenth be held in Haifa, a predominantly Jewish coastal city.","[SUHEIL DIAB] It was an intense struggle. Would the Papal mass be held in the historic city of Nazareth or end up in an irrelevant port? [AMJAD SABBARA] Haifa is of little importance in the New Testament. The prophet Elijah and Haifa are part of the Old Testament. The most important place is Nazareth. We were worried the city didn't have enough time to prepare for the Papal visit. It only had two months. [SUHEIL DIAB] The Israeli government created obstacles. We said we'd do it on our own. When they finally decided not to rule Nazareth out as a possibility we submitted a comprehensive plan. They argued intensively about every letter, every line, every date hoping to rule out Nazareth. It was clearly their political agenda.","[SUHEIL DIAB] Our biggest challenge was time. We finished everything five days in advance.","Your Holiness I'm the mayor of Nazareth, Ramiz Jaraisy. I'm very pleased [SUHEIL DIAB] I was among the last people to say goodbye to the Pope. I was waiting for this moment to reflect on our enormous effort.","When the helicopter took off, I thought of everything we had been through to pull this off. I realised we'd proved we could do it and that we can do many great things. In 2006, a serious incident occurred while the Catholic Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth was preparing for Easter. [SUHEIL DIAB] A group of Jews arrived from Jerusalem and used the main door. They approached the Grotto of the Annunciation, the most sacred part of the church. They set off explosives there. This was a racially-motivated attack. Thousands of local Nazareth people immediately rushed to the church and put out the fire.","The Israeli police picked up the three Jewish attackers who'd been surrounded by local residents. But some of the Arab Palestinian locals were arrested as they tried to protect their Church. An Israeli court later decided that the three Jewish attackers had been 'mentally unstable'. RAMIZ JARAISY FORMER MAYOR OF NAZARETH. The thousands who gathered here yesterday, in this street delivered a message to the Israeli establishment. We can't stand still in the face of racist campaigns. [ATALLAH HANNA] Whoever sets fire to a Church could next time destroy religious symbols and kill people.","This happens every day in Jerusalem. We are loathed, spat at and insulted. Visiting priests and pilgrims are insulted by fundamentalist Jews. Those who insult our priests could actually assault and hurt priests and might do even worse.","[MILATIOS BASAL] Wadi Qelt is part of the municipality of the Palestinian city of Jericho. Although in the West Bank, it's completely under the control of Israeli control. St. George's Monastery has religious significance.","The prophet Elijah worshiped there for a long time. Joachim, the father of the Virgin Mary, is said to have asked God for a child for his daughter here.","The Israeli regime often tried to evict the priests using psychological methods, like depriving them of water. They're not prohibited by the army from using the ancient well there. Archbishop Germanos valued manual labour and contemplation. Once he even stayed at the monastery alone. He was alone because priests were persecuted. It was hard to get permits, and then only for a short time.","But the monastery needed maintenance for wear and tear and the effects of humidity so Germanos undertook the project himself.","The Israeli military objected to this claiming he didn't have the necessary building permits. This was a problem in a disputed area like the West Bank.","There's no authority to grant building permits. With God's help he was able to widen the street and turn it into a real road rather than a narrow passage to allow more than one person at a time.","To pass this street widening angered the Israelis. Germanos even built a three-door gate, which also irritated the authorities. But they found no legal reason to prosecute him. In 2001, Father Germanos was driving back from Jerusalem to the Monastery in Jericho when an unidentified gunman shot him in the head and sped away.","The Catholic Church held Israel responsible. But Israel charged Palestinians though has so far provided no evidence to the Church against them. [MILATIOS BASA] Many allegations were made but any smart person could work this out.The bullets were fired at Father Germanos near the Israeli checkpoint area bordering the Palestinian territories. This is a high security area. If There are CCTV cameras on every street what about the security checkpoint?. Is it possible they never saw the gunman? Didn't the cameras record anything? Was the tape wiped?","[MILATIOS BASAL] There had been a previous incident, involving Father Philoumenos, in Nablus. Extremist Jews wanted to destroy Jacob's Well there so they planted a bomb inside.","When Father Philoumenos was passing he came across a round object. He didn't know what it was so he threw it out of the window. It exploded outside the church but he was unhurt. The extremist Jews were furious that he survived. In 1979, while he was going upstairs they stormed in and stabbed him to death.","He became a Martyr. His remains are kept there. [ATALLAH HANNA] I think remaining silent will lead to crimes like these being repeated. That's why we're still witnessing new incidents. I believe there are factions in the Israeli government who support these extremists.","It's not a fanatical faction problem.Extremists are being supported by government figures. When some Israeli ministers speak their language is as violent and racist as the attackers themselves.","[ATALLAH HANNA] There was another incident at the Monastery of Latrun. They used graffiti and also burned part of the monastery. If it wasn't for the vigilance of the priests one morning the whole monastery would have burned down. Thank God there were no casualties. But so far we've heard of no arrests for those crimes. [MILATIOS BASAL] Who protected the church I was in charge of? Our Muslim neighbours. A man and a woman stood together. They guarded the door and prevented an attack on the church. Those protecting churches are now our countrymen. Then there is Holy Saturday, at Easter. The yard of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre becomes a military barracks. Even priests aren't allowed to move freely.","The Israelis claim it's for security. But security is used as an excuse to stop worshippers entering the Church.","Jewish Passover occurs around the same time. Over half a million people enter the same area but there are no checkpoints. Jews are usually the ones afraid but there's no need for security on our holy days.","I was prevented from entering the Church many times although I'm a local priest. This is not about security. Jerusalem used to fill with Christian pilgrims at Easter and the Israeli authorities resented this. They don't want Jerusalem to be a centre for Christianity.","[MILATIOS BASAL] Persecution hasn't stopped of course. There's persecution to this day. It's not always physical but psychological, aimed at the mind. Sometimes it becomes more intense.","Origen lived through persecution in the early years of Christianity. He was arrested and tortured to make him deny Christ. He endured torture but didn't give in. They used many methods of torture. They hooked his legs with iron weights upside-down. But his inner peace calmed the other prisoners and pagans. The authorities even thought about setting him free.","Origen endured severe torture and later died of his injuries in the year 254 AD. He left over 70 pieces of writing and their legacy is still felt in the Holy land today.","[STEPHEN SIZER] From an Israeli perspective Palestinian tour guides are very dangerous, I think it was Ben Gurion who said he would have a Palestinian pilot flying an airplane over Israel than a Palestinian tour guide because in his view a Palestinian tour guide can do much more damage to the Israeli perspective than a fighter bomber.","[FADI QATTAN] When someone lives under occupation and behind a wall they're forced to get a permit that frees them from this prison.","But people realise that asking for a permit to exercise your religious right is a form of humiliation."],["","We will cut off the power.

I can't do anything. That is my job. Would you accept me cutting off the power if you were baking? Never. My children can't study. We can't wash our clothes. I can't do anything.

It's a strange job that only exists in Gaza. I cut the power off and reconnect it according to a set timetable.","I cut off the power to every home in Gaza for at least 8 hours every day. Every second, one third of Gaza's population is without electricity. [Rafah city] The Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are a people under siege Israel occupied Gaza back in 1967. Although Israeli forces withdrew in 2005, they have maintained a blockade on the territory. As a result, over one and a half million Palestinians suffer to this day from high levels of poverty and dependence on aid. The blockade has prevented the reconstruction of Gaza's infrastructure, so badly damaged during Israel's successive military assaults on Gaza in recent years. The problems faced by Sabah Barakat and her husband are common to many.","FATHI BARAKAT PALESTINIAN CITIZEN.","They demolished our three-storey house. We were moved to houses made from polythene. What a humiliation. And then they cut off the power. Israel's siege on Gaza Strip continues. When it's hot, we can't tolerate the heat inside these houses. We stay outside. The fans and the fridge broke down because of the heat. We live without dignity.","SABAH BARAKAT PALESTINIAN CITIZEN.","And in winter, how can we bear the cold? We have no heaters because of the electricity problems. All we can do is light a fire to keep us warm. We always have to check the electricity schedule to know what time the power cuts and for how long. We live our life around power cuts.","[Fathi] Sometimes they cut the power at different times.","[Sabah] We use a lot of candles and wood. Life is very difficult.","Sorry to keep you busy with us today.","It's OK.

That's all we can do.","We bake bread in clay ovens.","It was easier before when we had electricity.","We can manage.","Many women such as Sabah Barakat resort to cooking and baking on firewood in order to preserve the little gas they have. Gaza's electricity sector remains deficient. Israel refuses to allow in the spare parts needed to rebuild the broken-down infrastructure. Limited amounts of fuel reach Gaza from Israel and Egypt but it is well below even a bare minimum required.","[Gaza Power Station] SUHAIL SKAIK GENERAL DIRECTOR OF GAZA POWER STATION.","This is the only power plant in Gaza. It provides Gaza with almost 80 megawatts every day, while Gaza needs about 300 megawatts. This means it only provides the city 25 per cent of its needs.","The power plant came under Israeli attack in June 2006 and was shut down completely. We only have two other power suppliers; Egypt provides Gaza with 17 megawatts, and Israel gives us 120 megawatts.","We face a power crisis because the shortage covers 30 per cent of Gaza. KANAAN OBAID CHAIRMAN, GAZA POWER AUTHORITY.","Israel uses electricity as a weapon of war. Its first reaction to the capture of the soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006 was to bomb Gaza's power plant. They cut our power as a means of punishment. The power supply from Israel is the first to be cut during periods of conflict. It is also the last thing to be restored.","[Suhail] One of the 10 power lines coming from the Israeli side has been cut for eight days. We've contacted them but they haven't fixed it. Sometimes we have difficulty getting fuel for the power station. They give us only enough fuel to operate two units while the third remains out of action. We also have problems getting spare parts. The Israeli side causes all these problems on top of the occupation, they make our lives more difficult.","[Abdul Aziz] People have become so used to the power cut timetables they think their lives are normal if the timetables are running. Poor people.","Oh no! Power cuts every day. We have to take the stairs. Walk slowly. Power cuts everyday.","Electricity is a precious commodity in Gaza and daily power cuts create additional hardships. SABREEN DEEB PALESTINIAN CITIZEN.","The power cut timetables change every day. One day the power cuts in the morning, other times in the evening. Our children don't know when to study. We check the power cut timetables before going out. It's difficult to climb the stairs in the dark.","[Sabreen ] It's difficult if someone wants to visit us.

Often there is no option but to do their homework by gas lamp or candlelight. Palestinian school children in Gaza face enough of a challenge with frequent disruptions due to Israeli raids; poor school infrastructure; and overcrowding in classrooms. The lack of electricity is an additional hardship that risks hindering the right to an education.","I can't see anything.","SUHAIL SKAIK GENERAL DIRECTOR OF GAZA POWER STATION. People in Gaza can't live a modern life. We have many problems. A shortage of medicines, unemployment, suspended projects. On top of all this, we have power cuts. Ask anyone in Gaza and they will say power cuts are the main problem.","We can't live like this. The power cuts cause goods in supermarkets to expire due to no refrigeration. Even my granddaughter talks about the power cuts.","Yesterday they said they would increase the hours of power cuts. They will make it from 8am to 8pm. Great. Gaza's economy will be perfect! Even when the power is back, it keeps getting cut many times. And why don't they get us power from Egypt? Plus Gaza's electricity is the most expensive ever. People in other Arab countries pay much less than we do.","Hello! How are you? Hello! How are you? Hello! How are you?","We have no power at home. So I decided to join you by the fire.

They are all Chinese-made. All we can do is be patient. The best thing about the power cut is that it brings us all together like this.","SUHAIL SKAIK GAZA POWER STATION DIRECTOR. The people of Gaza have learnt the timetable of power cuts. Sometimes the outage lasts for eight hours in the day. Other times it lasts eight hours during the night. The third day there is no power cut. When it is cold, people use electric heaters as the houses are poorly insulated. More electricity is consumed though our power resources are the same. Demand increases and so do the duration of power cuts. That's why the timetables keep changing.","FATHI BARAKAT PALESTINIAN CITIZEN.","It's a big problem. They cut the power, but the water supply remains. How can we switch on water pumps without electricity! Then they cut the water too. What can we do?","Turn it off.","Does it consume a lot of diesel? -Yes. 4 liters a day.","This means extra charge. Apart from what you pay for the electricity.","EMAD HIJAZY WATER SELLER.","My name is Emad Hijazy, from Rafah. I've been selling water for five years. This is how I earn my living. Most of the time we have no power. People get generators to have electricity. We have a generator so we can pump the water.","[Emad] Natural water in Rafah is salty and polluted. So people mostly rely on buying this clean water. The water supplied by the municipality is unclean. It can't be used for drinking. So people have to buy filtered water.","MUNZIR SHIBLAQ WATER AUTHORITY DIRECTOR.","It was proved that only five per cent of Gaza's natural water can be used for drinking. We don't even have the power to supply residents with polluted water. So forget about projects requiring a lot of energy to filter the water! Gaza suffers from power shortages. And water projects are the largest consumers of electricity.","SUHAIL SKAIK GENERAL DIRECTOR OF GAZA POWER STATION.","Any new project needs electricity. A water desalination project needs about 80 megawatts. Building a new hospital, for example, needs about 10 megawatts. No project can succeed without electricity. Even if we were to use generators, they can only run for a few hours.","MUNZIR SHIBLAQ DIRECTOR, AL-SAHEL WATER AUTHORITY.","Another major problem is Gaza's sanitation system.

Both Gaza and Egypt will benefit from it. We feed Jordan, Syria and Lebanon with electricity. We will soon feed Iraq too. We don't mind helping any neighbouring Arab country as long as it comes within the framework of legal agreements.","[Kanaan] If Egypt were to feed Gaza with power, we would be talking about a very small amount in terms of power. Gaza may need 600 megawatts by 2030. This is relatively tiny. Egypt consumes 27,000 megawatts. The 300 that Gaza needs is about 1 per cent of Egypt's consumption. This 1 per cent would hardly affect Egypt's own power supply.","[Aktham] Our power system is ready. We can start activating this project anytime. But it's a huge project. It needs power stations and electricity pylons. Our system is ready but the Palestinians also need to be ready to start operating the project.","The Palestinians say they are ready. They Egyptian side says it is ready. Why hasn't the project been implemented yet?","[Aktham] It might be a technical issue, but we are ready to start implementing the project.","[Kanaan] The project is financed by the Islamic Development Bank. Its budget is available. The plans are ready. The land in Gaza is ready. It is not a technical issue. It is political. We have asked for Egypt's permission to start building the infrastructure for the project in Gaza, but they have yet to agree.","ABDEL HALIM QANDIL POLITICAL ACTIVIST.","Slowing down the process of feeding Gaza with power and gas, I believe is a political problem rather than a technical one. Technically speaking, all are in agreement. So there are no technical problems.","And Egypt will not lose anything. On the contrary it will benefit economically because Gaza's Palestinians are willing to pay for this power. They are already paying the Israelis. It is all related to a political decision.","[Kanaan] Gaza is deprived of power because of politics. Deprived of cement because of politics. Deprived of construction projects because of politics. Our children will die because of politics. Our entire life is suspended because of politics.","[Qandil] It is a paradox. Egypt feeds Israel with gas but refuses to feed Gaza with gas or power.","[Kanaan] Israel still uses its power lines feeding Gaza as a tool of punishment.

I lived there until 1962 when I returned to Greece. These years left an impression on me because my family were an important part of the Greek community in Egypt. A large community of more than 100,000 people.","One event that played a decisive part in forming my position, later on, regarding the Palestinian issue and other Arab issues in general, was the 1956 war, the Suez Canal war.","[TV COMMENTARY] The Suez Canal, storm center of controversy for weeks, now becomes a cause of war in a lightning sequence of diplomatic and military moves. Since its seizure and nationalization by President Nasser of Egypt, the vital waterway has precipitated a new crisis in the already tense Middle East. Crack French units are embarked at Marseilles, down for a joined staging area with Great Britain on Cyprus, less than an hour's flight from Egyptian ports, where they are prepared for seizure of the Canal by force.","[Vangelis Pissias] Both my uncle and my school-teacher wore the Egyptian uniform and joined the Egyptian army as volunteers. This was a clear stance to take on the part of the members of the Greek community back then. During that war which lasted for several weeks, Alexandria was bombed. As a child I remember we covered the windows with blue paper to stop the light from getting out. I remember one child who used to run through the street shouting \"Switch off the light\" so that the planes couldn't see the locations they were targeting.","[Paul Larudee ] It was in 1965.

So, it makes you really fall in love with the place, I am not the first who fell in love with Palestine.","[Vangelis Pissias] This boat trip is not the first time I get to know the occupied territories of Palestine. I've known them since 1996. Back then, as an engineer and the coordinator of a European project, I went there on many occasions and worked both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. We designed and built the first Palestinian Parliament in Ramallah. When I met President Arafat, my wish was to see the Palestinian Parliament move to its rightful location, Jerusalem.","[Bethlehem] [March 2002] [Paul Larudee] Now, we know what happened in March and in April of 2002. There were seven foreigners who were shot during the siege of Bethlehem. I was one of those seven and next to me was a young woman who was shot in the stomach. Both of us became some of the first people to create the Free Gaza Movement.","[The 'Free Gaza Movement' was founded in 2006. Its aim was to lift the siege imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip. It believed the only way to do this was from the sea.]","[Vangelis Pissias] There were many difficulties in carrying out this plan. We needed boats.","[Paul Larudee ] This project died a thousand deaths and every time it was about to die someone, somebody new, stepped forward to save the project. This put us in touch with Dr. Vangelis Pissias. He saved the project, at this point. -Why?

They would either expropriate the boats or blow them up and eliminate the people involved.","[Riad Hamad] I was born in Lebanon and I came here in 1970 to go to school.","[Paul Larudee] A dear friend of mine, Riad Hamad, became involved with our group and he traveled to Turkey, twice, to find boats for us, and he found them.","[Riad Hamad] We collected about 15.000 dollars and we will send them to Palestine.","[Paul Larudee] On the 15th of April, he was found dead in a lake with his hands and feet tied with tape and with tape around his eyes and mouth. This happened in Texas, in Austin, Texas. Officially, in Texas, they decided to call it a suicide. And I was the last person to speak to him while he was alive, only one half hour before his death. And I know that he thought that he was being persecuted by government authorities, and also by non-government authorities and he told me about strange people with foreign accents in the yard of his neighbor collaborating with the police.","[Vangelis Pissias] My scientific research involves the desalinization of seawater. This has allowed me to know about the small shipyards. And in this way I was able to locate, initially, an old traditional boat.","[Spetses] [Vangelis Pissias ] And there, a very capable man agreed to take up the task of converting this boat and making it seaworthy, so that it could carry 20-25 people on a journey.","[Tassos Karambinas] It's the ideals one has about life, people, about Palestine, Gaza, people suffering.

But I think it was pure coincidence. I wasn't at all worried. Nobody knew anything.","[Vangelis Pissias] After a while we thought maybe one boat wouldn't suffice, and as the plan unfolded, it became apparent that we needed a second boat. As soon as the decision was made, this boat slipped in and out of Thodoris' shipyard in Eretria.","[Eretria] [Thodoris] We never suspected anything. We just thought you were going on holiday in August.","Thodoris Argiris Shipyard owner.","We would even work at night, with the lights on, so that you could go on holiday in August.

So when they offered me an opportunity to help, I didn't think twice, I said 'yes'.","[Yiannis Karipidis] I was very happy when Vangelis revealed to me that the people with whom he had set up the whole project were the same people he had worked with as an outlaw during the years of resistance to the military junta. So it was a good experience to meet them.","[Activists of the Free Gaza Movement from abroad start arriving in Greece. ]","[Michalis Tiktopoulos] We set up watch posts around the camp to protect the boats from possible sabotage. There was a lot of activity. Cars were coming and going. It was a series of small events that played a large part in the success of the mission.","[Petros Yiotis] Ken O'Keefe, an ex-marine who gave up the American citizenship, was part of it. He was very capable. He understands ships and was very helpful. Darlene helped out with the electronics. The rest did menial jobs because there was also a lot of drudgery, like carrying stuff.","OJ, the English woman, hardly weighs 50 kilos and yet she would carry over three tons of sailing ballast.","The most important thing was to keep the boats concealed from the Greek or Israeli Secret Service. And we achieved that. They didn't have a clue. Why? Because we applied the tried and tested art of conspiracy. We did something legal, but in great secrecy. And so we succeeded.","[Michalis Tiktopoulos ] To maintain this secrecy, in order to protect the boats, we used pay-as-you-go phones. We never spoke to one another on our personal phones.","[Nikos Bolos] We had a lot of problems and difficulties, but everyone was determined to reach Gaza at all costs.","[Petros Yiotis] Should I start keeping a log book?","Here I go then Friday, August 8, 8 pm sharp.","Ai Nicholas, one of the two Greek fishing boats, begins its journey to Gaza.

From Spetses and Eretria to Chania we managed with our amateur captains and with the rest of us taking the helm and acting as crew. From now on though, things will change. We are entering the high seas. Our boats are in need of experienced professional captains. A captain hired by the Free Gaza Movement turns out to be incompetent.","[Captain Mathew] The journey from here to the eastward end of the island is all on shore winds. If we have one engine failure and we are two miles off shore, that means very quickly we will be blown on to the shore, potentially on to the rocks and you can forget about the boat.","[Vangelis Pissias] The volunteers from abroad, despite their good intentions, couldn't handle such ships which are Greek traditional ships and which travel in seas unknown to them.","[Captain Mathew ] I hadn't considered in any way, shape or form going fifty miles off shore in a straight direction to Cyprus.","[Vangelis Pissias] So we had a lot of problems, but we managed to find the very capable Yiorgos Klontzas, a captain from Crete who I knew from before. He's also a very good diver and has taken part in other missions.","Yorgos Klontzas, Captain.","I didn't know what was going on, and I didn't even know where Gaza was. I just told them 'Let's go from here, get as far as Cyprus, as we have arranged, and if I like the company, we will proceed to Gaza.' That's what I told them back then in Chania.","[Petros Yiotis] Sunday, August 17th 10.30 in the morning we sail towards the Dodecanese. The two ships sail next to each other so that they have visual contact and can support each other in case of any problem. The weather is fine. The sea is calm.","[Kastelorizo] During World War II Great Britain decided to bomb Kastelorizo because at the time it was under Italian occupation. People fled, and where did they go?

We spend them discussing the details of the final phase of our mission.","[Vangelis Pissias] I can tell you, since April, when we found the first boat and started refitting it, I haven't been able to sleep properly. I feared that any moment my phone would ring and someone would tell me that the boat has been blown up.","[Vangelis Pissias' fears were not unfounded. In 1988 the PLO tried to send a ship from Cyprus to Gaza. ]","[Vangelis Pissias] That ship was sabotaged and blown up inside the port of Limassol and all three members of the mission were killed when their car was booby-trapped in the city of Limassol.","[Petros Yiotis] Wednesday, August 20 Around 8 am we arrive in Larnaca.

And this was a very important decision to take.","[Huwaida Arraf ] If they fire in the air, not at the boat, then they are only trying to scare us.","[Anne Montgomery] What we want to do is keep going.","[Musheir El Farra] We are wasting time and people are really determined to go. Even if it is three against two we are saying 'we go' and this is how the system works and we vote.","[Yiannis Karipidis] Our job here is almost done. We have papers that say we have the right to go to Gaza.","[Jeff Halper ] We have to go and break the siege.","[Vangelis Pissias] It was a very moving moment. Everyone, all who took part in this mission, whatever fears they may have had, big or small, overcame them.","As we kept going, we saw that there were no boats moving against us and I remember then that we started looking at each other smiling, despite the tension, as if we were saying 'You think? You think we will make it there? Could we be passing through?'","[Petros Yiotis] Saturday, August 23 2008 We are 6.5 miles away from Gaza. The Palestinian flag is raised on the right side of our boat. According to the International Maritime Law, this is a sign that the two Greek boats are now entering Palestinian waters. It is the first time in 41 years that a ship from abroad sails into Gaza.","[Vangelis Pissias] That was when I felt the dream had come true, and I was on the verge of setting foot on Gaza soil.","[Paul Larudee] So when we saw the coast of Gaza, when I saw the coast of Gaza, I said 'My God! We are actually going to arrive! We are going to succeed!'","[Vangelis Pissias ] After that we saw the first boats coming towards us from inside the port. It was an extraordinary moment. Meeting those people was the greatest moment in my life.","[Paul Larudee] I am sixty two years old. So now, I find out why I am sixty two years old. I find out why I have been placed on this earth. Cause all of the time, everything I have done in my life is for this moment. If I never do anything else in my life, it's enough.","[Yiorgos Klontzas] I cried on the bridge for five minutes without knowing why I was crying.","[Yiannis Karipidis] There wasn't a single one of us who wasn't jumping for joy and crying when we entered the port. If you haven't made such a journey, you simply can't imagine what it's like to arrive.","[Vangelis Pissias ] You can't imagine those children's eyes looking at you from the water, they jumped into the sea and were swimming towards the boat. It's a scene one can never imagine. It's a scene that once you see, you'll never forget it. I will never forget it for the rest of my life. There was one child in particular. The captain shouted at me to tell the children to stay clear in case the propeller hit them. So I shouted 'Watch out! It's a dangerous!' And that child just looked at me and laughed with his friends, and he shouted back 'There's no danger in Palestine'.","You could see smiles on their faces, like flowers blooming. It's hard to imagine that these people, who have been under siege for so long, could have so much strength, optimism and so much joy and laughter.","[Vassos Lissaridis] Quite often history is written by those that the wiser and more prudent might call 'unreal'. The 'unreal' are those that make history.","[Vangelis Pissias] We were not commandos, we were not a militant group. We were people from very different backgrounds heading towards our destination, Gaza, with one thing in common, a common belief.","[Paul Larudee] We wanted to show that anybody can do this. Anywhere in the world, that we can make it happen.","[Vangelis Pissias ] We shared the belief that we were doing the right thing, and there was hope and solidarity. More than a million people in Gaza are suffering, but they have shone a light on all people who believe in freedom. It doesn't matter if we look the same or not or if we have the same culture or not, civilization or if we have the same beliefs.","[Michalis Tiktopoulos] Different in what sense? In that they have a different religion, and different customs? The point is: they are fighting, they are struggling, and that is the way. In the end everything else will follow.","[Petros Yiotis] Why did I go on this mission? Because had I not gone I would have been ashamed for the rest of my life.","[Tassos Karambinas] I would do it all over again. For the same reason, for the same purpose.","[Yiorgos Klontzas] There is a difference between right and wrong. If you tell me to rob a bank, I will tell you I don't rob banks. If you tell me to go to Gaza right now, let's go.","[Vangelis Pissias] This journey to Gaza, the first journey to Gaza, isn't over yet.

All this has been erased","[Raef Zreik] We realise what we've lost when we hear people's stories about Palestine before 1948. People who went to clubs, and to movies in Haifa spent the night there. The next day they took taxis from Al Hanateer Square back home to the American University of Beirut. You could do what you liked. We not only lost our cities in 1948 but also our open relationship with the Arab world.","SUAD QARAMAN WRITER. A French university professor was once lecturing the Israelis about how to deal with what he called 'strangers', foreigners. I went crazy listening to him. We'd become foreigners in our own country!","My father Abdel Raouf Qaraman was a merchant. My uncle had always sought to start new family businesses, communication facilities, social events, political activities.","He was deputy mayor and met the Russian Jew, Pinhas Rutinberg, who brought electricity to my town, Ibtin.","They dug wells to create irrigation systems for farms. They had farms in Ibtin and another nearby town. They had horses and cows. My uncle imported Dutch cows. They built a factory for diary products. It had advanced machines to make cheese and other dairy products.","ADEL MANNA HISTORIAN. Palestine started exporting agricultural products during the Ottoman era to neighbouring Arab countries and cities like Istanbul. Wheat, sesame seeds, corn and cotton.","In the 19th century, it started exporting citrus products. Jaffa oranges became popular in Berlin, London, Paris and other western cities after 1865. FAKHRI JDAI PHARMACIST.","Jaffa exported oranges. We used to go to our friends' farms in neighbouring towns and watch them wrap oranges in paper and put them in boxes for export.","The British built Faisal Street for the movement of trucks carrying fruit from Jaffa and neighbouring towns to the port","[JAFFA PORT, 1940s] ISMAIL ABU SHEHADEH JAFFA CITIZEN. Fruit Farms started to expand when generators were introduced. Before that, they had sprinklers watering only 1.5 hectares. The generators helped irrigate more land. So in the 1930s, farms started to expand up to about 50 hectares.","One day in 1939 Jaffa port had 46 ships preparing to export fruit [Ismail Abu Shehadeh] At the port, workers loaded the orange boxes onto ships. Up to 70 workers might work together at the same time. People from Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Yemen and Marrakech all used to work in Palestine.","Jaffa city was Palestine's main centre during the British mandate for several reasons but mainly because of its port.","Jaffa was Palestine's commercial gateway, serving agriculture and industry. This led to the huge growth of Jaffa into Palestine's main centre.","Askalan, Gaza, Haifa and Jerusalem were the main provinces. But they all really depended on Jaffa.","It was the hub of industry, commerce and labour and so the heart of Palestine.","We know that many Palestinian families were very rich, like the Al Khayat and Qaraman families in Haifa. The Qaraman family had farms and was later involved in industry too.","My family, the Qaramans had cigarette, ice-cream and coffee factories. We also manufactured salt and glass lanterns with my father's name on. Qaraman halva was the best and most famous in Palestine.","Two main public transport companies, Al Alamain and Haddad, started up in Jaffa.","First they started local routes from Jaffa to Jerusalem, Ramleh and Haifa. Two years later, they expanded with routes into Beirut. When I was a student, I took the bus from Jaffa to Beirut for one Palestinian lira.","Jaffa had special social status, with a capitalist infrastructure. It had trades unions. Jaffa had more advanced technology than other Middle Eastern cities. It had railways and electricity.","Jaffa had railway lines to Haifa, Bir Al Saba and Al Arish in Egypt.","My grandmother and aunts lived in Cairo. They once asked my father to let me and my sister visit them. My father sent us alone on the train from Jaffa to Al Arsih. We were young. The station staff in Al Arish helped us get on the train to Cairo where my cousins were waiting for us.","Jaffa had excellent factories and blacksmiths, making the best horseshoes. Israel can't make horseshoes like that even today.","We had the best steel factories, building generators. You can still find the old Palestinian Iron Foundry logo on manhole covers.","Many economic projects helped develop the identity of Jaffa city but its cultural and social sides were even more significant.","Palestine published hundreds of daily and weekly newspapers over 200 during the British mandate, mainly in Jaffa and Haifa.","My father was a big reader, buying newspapers every day, with local news about Jaffa's industry, oranges, cotton and so on.","In 1939, they reported war news.","There were several political parties in Palestine before 1948. The Arab Palestinian party, led by al-Husseinis and the National Defence Party, led by the al-Nashashibis.","There were also several opposition parties like the communist National Liberation League.","Communists had strong union awareness. There were a lot of Arab workers in Palestine.","Under the British mandate, workers believed in the importance of the class struggle.","Communists launched the Arab Labour Conference to encourage Arab workers to defend their rights within the capitalist labour structure in Palestine at that time.","They launched a newspaper to promote their ideas among workers and society.","We also got Egyptian newspapers like 'Rose Al Youssef', 'Al Cinema Wa Al Nas' and 'Sabah El Kheir'.","There was a satirical paper called 'Al Baaqouqa' which means the 'mess'. There were also magazines and short novels but they were expensive. We used to go to the libraries in Jaffa every Friday to read them.","Palestinian cities had great cultural life, especially in Jaffa, Haifa and Jerusalem. They had cultural exchanges with other Arab cities.","Egypt's great singer, Umm Kathoum, held several concerts in Jaffa. Top Arab theatre star, Yousef Wahbi, performed on stage in Jaffa.","Haifa had many cultural activities. Great artists from several countries came. Egyptian musician Abdel Wahab and Umm Kalthoum performed in Haifa as well as Ali Al Kassar.","Haifa's cinemas and theatres had Arab films and other cultural activities.","In Jaffa, we had five cinemas, including Al Rasheed, Farouq, Al Hamra and Nabil.","Palestinian film production started here at this time. Some people say Arab cinema started in Palestine with the Lama Brothers, before moving to Egypt and the Levant.","Films starring famous Arab actors would play in Palestinian cinemas for four months.","My sister loved the actress and singer Asmahan. She used to watch her films five times.","I once saw a film starring Asmahan called 'Love and Revenge' at the Hamra cinema.","I heard that Asmahan died right after she had made that film.","I once skipped school with my younger brother and sister to see it. When we got home, my parents saw I had my brother's school bag but he hadn't come home with us. They found out we'd skipped school and I got into trouble, as the eldest.","I have a good memory. I still remember some of the old songs.","Sabah, the singer, had an old song that went: 'Just like roses... No one is like me... A beautiful 17-year old young lady'.","Sabah, the Lebanese singer appeared in nearly 100 movies, and is still fresh in Ismail Shehada's memory. Palestine's cinemas and theatres were alive but the impact of 1948 on both would be crushing.","In the 1930s and early 40s, life in the cities of Palestine was full and active, typified by Jaffa with its busy port and commercial centre.","The cultural scene was also strong, with movie production, theatre-going and a variety of writing.","Antoine Shalhat Researcher.","Palestine had a thriving theatre. We had distinguished playwrights and theatre musicians. One of the most famous Palestinian writers was Nasri Al Jawzi.","If critics reviewed his writings, they'd see his influences were local but also contemporary Arab and international theatre.","Ismail Abu Shehada Jaffa Citizen.","Palestine had good writers and poets, like Ismail Al Tobasi. He kept going to jail because he always wrote nationalistic poems.","This shows that Palestinian intellectuals made a major contribution to cultural life.","Palestinian novelists were also published in the cities, like the famous Najati Sidqi and Mahmoud Al Irani.","Palestinian fiction always kept pace with the whole of Arab literature.","Zionist strategy was to undermine Palestinian urban cultural identity. Zionists saw that Palestinian cities were a danger to their overall aims. That's why they waged a brutal war against the cities more than the countryside.","They forced out Palestinian city-dwellers, 34 per cent of the population, by the end of the British mandate. RAEF ZREIK WRITER.","Targeting the cities meant pushing people into camps, into small towns like Kafr Manda and Shefa Amr. But between these towns was the city which was a big influence on surrounding areas. They depended on it, so destroying the city meant losing the heart of all Palestinian areas.","The Nakba was deliberately planned to destroy Palestinian existence.","People were forced out of their homes and their neighborhoods were destroyed. They were put in small camps.","Israel enforced a military law that put Palestinians in confined areas and which prevented them from moving around.","Pregnant women couldn't go to hospital to have their babies. The dead couldn't be removed. Students couldn't go to school.","They wiped out the life of so many people. ADEL MANNA HISTORIAN.","The Israeli capture of Jaffa and Haifa led to the expulsion of the vast majority of the Palestinian population of these two cities. People were forced out of their homes and factories. The Israelis destroyed their cultural life and looted their work places.","The 1948 Palestinian cause was a disaster. An entire nation lost their homeland overnight. It was a catastrophe. A majority became a minority in its own country.","In a population of 90,000 only about 2,000 people stayed for example. People lost their way of life overnight. Suddenly bakers and merchants suddenly couldn't go to their shops. An entire material and moral life was lost.","Only a few thousand Palestinians stayed in Jaffa and Haifa. They were all put in ghettos. One was in Al Nisnas district in Haifa and another in the old city in Jaffa. The few Palestinian families who remained were forced out and put in barbed-wire fenced areas, like a prison.","Israel took control of the entire Palestinian city life.","A Palestinian poet in Haifa sent his daughter to study in the American University of Beirut before 1948.","She couldn't go back home after what happened. She wrote to her father, saying: 'Don't forget to water my jasmine tree'.","He wrote back: 'Your father is watering it with his tears. He experienced Arab nationalism and is now lamenting it'.","People living in Palestinian cities felt they had lost their relationship with the city and also the social support of places like Beirut, Damascus and so on. This added to their misery. Palestine's heart disappeared. The centre that used to feed its surroundings disappeared. The elite disappeared. You can't have national projects without cities, intellectuals disappeared The middle class disappeared.","The social class that generated values goals and ambitious disappeared. The backbone of society disappeared. People who made life's dreams come true disappeared.","When people started to leave Jaffa, my father ran around its streets, begging people to stay.","He told them death was better than leaving, but they left anyway. Jaffa was lost.","Jaffa was prosperous with its grandeur, its clubs and its people. Now all of this has gone. I only feel comfortable in my own home. When I go outside, I feel like a stranger in my own land.","An old proverb says: 'Little food doesn't help the weak'. Jaffa is weaker for its lack of Palestinians. There's no club or coffee shop for Palestinians in Jaffa. I wish I could meet people like me here in Jaffa.","The destruction of Jaffa led to the massive growth of Tel Aviv. The Israelis have seized all of its land and property.","Many of Jaffa's Palestinian neighbourhoods have become Jewish areas. Some of the streets still have Arabic names.","The land north of Jaffa has all been seized. New buildings have been built, even on Islamic sites like cemeteries. The city of Jaffa has been destroyed.","Other abuses have now come to light. As well as fighting, Zionist forces had a systematic plan to steal the cultural treasure of Palestinian cities.","Expulsions put an end to the Palestinian press. Israeli forces also looted Palestinian public and private libraries with important Arabic books and publications.","The Israelis have done all they can to prevent new Palestinian cities replacing the lost ones. Nazareth is the perfect example.","Nazareth had the potential to develop and become a Palestinian city in Galilee. But this was contained by the confiscation of lands and the creation of Upper Nazareth. It was prevented from developing by military rule.","Nazareth city was a distinguished Arab centre even during the British mandate.","It's been emptied of its Arab population. All its ministries, government institutions, infrastructure and economic resources have been transferred to the new Jewish city, reducing Nazareth to a big village.","It is difficult for Nazareth to develop into a Palestinian city under a state that constantly fights the very existence of Palestinians.","Nazareth could have developed into to become a city but Israel didn't want to. With proper investment, it could have succeeded but they prevented that.","The success of the Hebrew State was built on the destruction of Arab industry.","It was destroyed by the expulsion of its people.","The few Palestinians who stayed made huge efforts to start new industries and businesses but military rule prevented them from getting work permits.","The Qaraman and Salti cigarette factory was the biggest in Palestine. It made a million cigarettes a day. The Israelis occupied the factory and our house. The shops were looted. Nothing was left. It was all destroyed.","Haifa's Arab neighbourhoods were seized. They were used to host the newcomers.","Haifa municipality and the Israeli government are still trying to destroy the city's Arab culture and old buildings.","Wadi Al Salib in Haifa was an Arab neighbourhood. but was destroyed.","Many Palestinians went back to find their homes had been seized by the newcomers. They had to rent other houses. They couldn't take their furniture and belongings. Many other buildings were destroyed.","I once passed the site of my old primary school. It had been demolished. It was a beautiful building. I asked why it had been demolished. They wanted to expand the car parking for the vegetable market. They don't want to leave a trace of Palestinian heritage. Under the pretext of development, the Israelis put up modern, western-style government buildings near Haifa port. They wanted to westernise the architecture of the city to make the Arab inhabitants feel like they were not at home. These modern buildings were put up among what remained of the old Arab homes. They made Haifa more like Tel Aviv. When a visitor arrives in Haifa, they feel it's a modern Israeli city, with a few Arab features here and there. Haifa has become an Israeli city with few Arab residents.","Some aspects of the Palestinian city life have started to re-emerge during the past 20 years in Haifa, around the Jewish city. About 40,000 Palestinians live in Haifa's Arab neighbourhoods. They've started cultural and artistic activities. A middle-class has grown up outside the cities economy.","How can we talk about Haifa being a Palestinian city? Its mayor is not Palestinian. Haifa municipality doesn't want to revive Palestinian cultural life. The University of Haifa is not Palestinian.","This means Haifa is not a Palestinian city.","There are some people living a Palestinian life in Haifa.","These Palestinians don't own factories or companies. They can't use Haifa port for import and export.","Economies need resources, land, cash and government support. These will never be available to Palestinians under Israeli rule.","Zionism has led to the loss of the Palestinian city identity. It's lost, geographically and in people's memories.","It was all planned, to prevent the Palestinians developing, to keep us in the lowest social and economic brackets. It's not a coincidence that in Israeli official statistics Palestinian cities and villages rank the lowest, socially and economically.","Israel puts Palestinians permanently in this position. So the choice is between staying in the city but opting out, or becoming a 'nationalist' to maintain your values and culture. But either way, Israel will ensure you're an outcast from city life.","It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rebuild Palestinian cities the way they once were. Their culture and communities have changed forever.","Most Palestinians living in Israel today and under occupation were born after 1948. They have only heard about what was lost.","A collective memory is dying. Surviving only in personal testimonies from a bygone era and grainy black-and-white photographs and film.",""],["Boycott Israel! Citizens, condemn Israel for being a criminal and terrorist state.","The siege imposed by Israel is encouraged by the silence of the international community.","The Italian government collaborates with the criminal state by a military agreement which we demand be immediately suspended.","We are not partners with Israel's politics. We stand behind Palestine. We are all Palestine. We are against the occupation and colonisation of the Palestinian people.","We won't be intimidated.","We will continue despite the power of the Zionist lobby in our country.","Our struggle hasn't yet reached a critical mass. But in time it will grow into a popular movement similar to that which defeated apartheid in South Africa. Palestine is free. They think they can do anything because governments are backing them.","We are not those governments. We are the people.","Our voice will be heard.","A good day to all the listeners of Radio Citt Aperta.","Welcome to our daily press review.","The Maxi catches one of the Lombard mafia.","My name is Mila Pernice.","I'm a journalist and presenter with Radio Citt Aperta in Rome.","I'm also an activist with the Palestine Forum.","It's an Italian network of committees and associations in solidarity with the Palestinian people.","We offer political support more than just humanitarian or cultural support.","In the past few years we've succeeded in getting more people to be part of our activities.","The Forum has helped raise awareness and mobilise people. This proves public opinion doesn't always agree with what is said in the official media.","Here in Rome, we created the Rome Network in solidarity with the Palestinian people.","Besides the Palestine Forum, it includes other associations and groups.","It was mainly formed to organise the boycott, divestmentand the sanction campaign against Israeli products. We meet each week to decide on our activities. If the organisers of these different flotillas don't coordinate then it will be difficult for us to make progress.","It seems the massacre on the flotilla has made the international activists more determined to continue on the same path.","But previous experience shows we have more difficulties ahead.","I think we should start defining the political dimensions of this matter.","In particular, I mean the well-known figures going on these boats. The more important they are, the better it is.","As a network, and particularly as the Rome Network, I think what Germano has just mentioned is a key point.","We need to decide how we give our political support and how we commit to breaking the siege of Gaza. I am more in favour in supporting those boats which are passing through Italy.","The Viva Palestina will pass through Ancona port on its way to Gaza. And any Italian boat.","Let's call for a national meeting and work on what was just mentioned by Germano.","Why do we support the Palestinian cause? Because it's an obvious injustice facing the whole world. And because we are against imperialists and colonialists.","If I speak of Zionism as a colonialist ideology supported by imperialist countries, then the struggle against Zionism is not only a Palestinian struggle.","It is mine, yours and ours. My name is Rossana Platone and I retired several years ago. I used to teach Russian language and literature at university.","As I am old, I witnessed the unfolding events that led to the birth of the state of Israel.","I welcomed this news. This was natural because I came from a left-wing family.","We were all standing with the Jews because of their persecution.","However, my attitude towards the Middle East issue changed during the 1967 war. The occupation of Palestinian land and the successive colonisation of this land were the reasons why I changed my point of view.","Now I am part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.","This was called by the Palestinian civil society. It was joined by many European and non-European countries.","I am personally interested in these campaigns as well as part of a specific group called Stop Agrexco.","Its main aim is to boycott Israeli agricultural products, specifically those coming from the Israeli settlements.","In 2008, a national meeting was held in Pisa to launch the boycott campaign in Italy.","There, I met two people from Rome and we decided to start the Stop Agrexco group in Rome. We haven't done much yet. Mainly in grocery stores. We distribute leaflets in the supermarkets and invite people to stop buying these products.","Whilst in supermarkets, we ask to meet the managers. We achieved some positive results, in the beginning.","Two major Italian supermarket chains, Coop and Conad, suspended the sale of these products.","Of course, there was a strong reaction. They came under intense pressure and they had to back down. Perhaps we should say a few words about this year.","In recent months, we've had a positive response from many people. This is excellent and it shows the boycott is working well.","It is effective in motivating people. Based on these results, we should review the campaign and think of a new one.","Let's make new leaflets. Not just about Agrexco but include a list of all products coming from the Israeli settlements.","Let's start a campaign about the need to respect international law. Through this we can talk about the Palestinian issue.","And if anyone boycotts another country which is contravening human rights then that's an added benefit.","The main idea is there: the need to respect international law through boycotting Israeli products. We can work on developing these ideas to present to the Network on the 22nd.","We are not isolated from our society. We are a minority and we think differently from public opinion. But that doesn't mean we're marginalised.","We each have our own work, friends and social circles. Marginalisation is different.","The only risk we face is that of physical aggression against us by extremists from the Jewish community in Rome. Until now, this hasn't happened to us. But it's possible.","Therefore, when distributing leaflets we avoid sending out one or two people.","Instead we go out in small groups. This is just a precaution. We will continue as always. [Offida] 51 countries from all over the world are taking part in this World Youth Cycling Championship. We made it 52.","Here in Offida, you can see the flags of each of these 51 countries. We decided to put up the Palestinian flag and to hang it above the Israeli flag.","This is an affirmation of a state that still doesn't exist. It has to exist and it wants to exist.","We felt everyone here in this city should see the Palestinian flag above the Israeli one.","My name is Enrico Bartolomei. I was born in Offida, a small city in central Italy.","I am currently working on my PhD at the University of Macerata.","My main subject is the history of Euro-Mediterranean region. Particularly Israel and Palestine.","My interest in Palestine is a result of a series of incidents.","The first incident happened after I borrowed a book from the library. Inside this book I found a piece of paper, like a bookmark between the pages.","It was a photocopy of an article about the link between the holocaust and the birth of the state of Israel and how it contributed in empowering Israel.","On the same piece of paper there was a hand-written note. Maybe from the previous reader.","The note read: 'What about the Palestinian holocaust?'","The idea of a Palestinian holocaust even just the use of the word holocaust. For Italians, and for Germans, this word is a taboo and is associated with the tragedy of the Jews and their extermination in Europe.","The use of this term to express the tragedy of another people was shocking to me.","Over time, I became more curious and had a strong wish to see Palestine and to know more about the Palestinian tragedy.","So in 2005 during the summer break, I decided to do a month's voluntary work in one of the Palestinian refugee camps.","I chose Aida Camp behind the separation wall.","There were around 20 international volunteers. We were sponsored by a local Palestinian association called the Leja Centre. I helped in rebuilding the garden of one of the schools.","I also visited the conflict zone. This had a strong emotional impact on me.","I made good contacts with some popular resistance committees protesting against the separation wall and the Israeli settlements.","After each Friday prayer, the villages of the West Bank organise peaceful demonstrations against land confiscation, the building of settlements and the separation wall.","It was interesting to be part of these weekly activities. It helps focus the role of the international activists and arouses interest in those curious to go to Palestine to become activists.","When you go to Palestine and see the injustice there, in this small land, you can't forget what you have seen.","When you witness this, you start feeling part of the cause. You feel your destiny is somehow tied to that of the land and the Palestinian people.","This will be my fourth trip to the occupied territories of Palestine.","I must decide what to take, just the necessary things.","An Arabic language dictionary will be important because I'll be taking an intensive Arabic course. This will help me read documents in their original Arabic language. It will be very useful for my research.","I will study at Birzeit University. So I'll take some dictionaries of Palestinian vocabulary and Arabic.","These will probably give me trouble at the airport. I'll face many questions at the airport.","Whoever goes to the Palestinian occupied territories, whether from Jordan, Israel or any other country, must pass through Israeli security checkpoints at the airport.","I'll be subjected to a series of questions about my visit. Why am I going to Israel? What are my intentions? For how long? What places will I be visiting and will I be meeting any Arabs?","I'm going to have to accept this and be part of this charade.","I'll say that I'm not going to the Palestinian occupied territories that I won't be speaking to any Palestinians. I'll have to pretend the Palestinians don't exist.","This has been the aim of the Zionist project from day one to deny the existence of the Palestinian people. Birzeit is the largest university in Palestine. In which city?","Ramallah Ramallah.","Have you been to Ramallah?","No, I haven't.","You've only been to Jericho, Bethlehem and Jerusalem.","Can foreigners live there or do they have to live in Israel?","Ramallah is part of the Palestinian territories, there are many hotels, accommodation and families offer places to stay. When Enrico told us about his plan to go to Palestine as a peace activist, we were a little unsure because of the dangerous situation there.","Our first reaction was to ask him to be careful since it was a place of conflict. And we know the nature of our son. He wouldn't hold back in tense situations. We were quite concerned, especially my wife. She was more worried than me. We were stressed for a while but made sure he didn't notice that. Because he is an adult and he is the only one who should decide his future.","We visited almost all the cities in the occupied territories-Jenin, Nablus, Hebron, Jerusalem and Bethlehem.","We met with many associations working in the occupied territories.","What do the Israeli companions think of the Palestinian situation?","We spoke to the Israeli Communist Party. They are understanding and critical of Israeli politics. They hope for a two-state solution.","The only solution is to create an independent Palestinian state with its own economy. One that is not controlled by the Israeli army and their checkpoints.","There has been a huge territorial re-mapping which makes the two-state solution practically impossible.","Also, geographically it is impossible to remove half a million Israelis from the West Bank.","And Israel will never give up its grip on the water resources.","So what's the solution?","There's talk of a single state for both Palestinians and Israelis. But this requires a great effort.","Israel has to give up Zionism and the racist ideologies on which it was founded. It has to take a path of reconciliation. As in South Africa between the blacks and the minority whites, when the blacks used to live in isolated islands.","How?","It seems impractical but it's the only solution.","But that doesn't fits with the ideologies and polices of the Israeli government.","For now, we hope international pressure will at least help lift the siege of Gaza. But at the moment it's not very promising.","All these ridiculous measures don't deal with the core of the problem. Peace is still far away. [TURIN] We are ready for the vans coming from England and France. They will travel through Turin and Milan to Ancona port. These are some guidelines and a list of contacts in case of an emergency. I first met Alfredo Tradardi at the Erez crossing-point on Israel's border with Gaza in December 2002.","I was leaving Gaza as he was entering. We had a short talk. Then we met again here in Turin at some meetings. It's a unique story. It could make a romantic novel. In 2003 I was working in Gaza during the summer when he joined me there. He was traveling between Gaza and Ramallah. It proves you can still fall in love, whatever you age.","Since then we have been working together. In a decisive moment in 2004-2005, Alfredo thought to create this Italian group.","He had already joined other Italian groups such as Action for Peace. But they didn't offer the type of drive we were after.","So in 2006 Alfredo decided to start the International Solidarity Movement. Five vans, an ambulance and a medical car.","The British organisation are partners with ISM Italy and Viva Palestina in Italy. The British organisation has received from the authorities in Gaza a list of aid requested for the people of Gaza. My name is Alfredo Tradardi. I was born in L'Aquila on Christmas day of that terrible year 1936.","I was deeply marked by what happened in October 1944.","It was the day my father, who used to work as a magistrate in L'Aquila, came home in the evening dressed as an officer. He had left his office and joined the partisans in Abruzzo.","The next morning I was with my father as he left for the brigade. I was 8 years old. I said to to him: 'Papa, come back with a medal.'","My father answered: 'To earn a medal you have to die.'","And that was what happened. My father died at the age of 36 while leading the partisans.","I have been influenced by the moral legacy of my father and the partisans.","And by the resistance movement against fascism and Nazism which is part of few pages of Italian history of which we can be proud.","This is extremely important to me. My name is Diana Carminati. I worked at the University of Turin. I was teaching European contemporary history. I left my job in 2004, a few years before my pension.","There was a project in Gaza funded by the Turin council and women's association against the war in Gaza.","They asked me and some other people to be part of this project. Back then I was still a few years away from my pension. But I chose to start a different life.","I have a seven tonne truck available for you to use. In addition there's a small car if needed.","I will take care of all charges, costs and petrol etc.","I am not asking anything but to join the convoy.","I am an Italian citizen with a valid passport.","Your effort is great, thank you. Well, this is proof of what I've said. Support is growing.","I answer your appeal: 'Break the siege of Gaza.'","This is the aim of our campaign.","It is a real moral and political duty. Free Palestine immediately. This confirms that despite what this country appears to be and despite what we see on TV, this country has a rich cultural heritage and significant political understanding.","This country is rich in those whom I call ethical minorities. Minorities that pledge themselves to a cause with determination and compassion. From Turin to Gaza with Viva Palestina, the Italian convoy. After the dramatic and tragic events of the G8 meeting in Genoa in 2001, many social forums were started in Italy.","I remember this woman from Ivrea. She remembered me from when I used to work for Olivetti in 1960.","She gave me the programme of an Italian organisation called Action for Peace. It was one of the organisations campaigning on the Palestinian issue.","She was preparing for her first mission there between 2001 and 2002. The truth is, I wasn't felling well back then. But I decided to go along.","This experience was decisive. After that, I kept going back to Palestine. In 2002 I went four times. I have continued dedicating all my time to the cause of Palestine.","My name is Frank Hughes. I come from the Belfast to Gaza crew. This vehicle is going to be donated to the James Connoughly surgical unit at the Al Auda hospital in Gaza. The money that we used are donated from the North of West Belfast and the North of Ireland or the occupied six counties as it is sometimes referred to. The hospital specifically requested for a mini-bus with wheelchair access. So there are different typrd of medical aid going to Gaza on this medical convoy from all over the world. People sometimes ask why seven men from Ireland would drive for four weeks to drive four thousand miles for complete strangers to go into a foreign country for people who don't even share the same religion, the same culture, the same language. All I can say is the oppression suffered by the people in Palestine is exactly the same that happened in Ireland 150 years from British tyrannical, empirical rule. For eight hundred years the people of Ireland have resisted foreign occupation. We feel very very passionately and strongly the pain of the Palestinian people.","Good evening and welcome.","Diana Carminati and I were part of last year's convoy.","We know the difficulties ahead. We also know the determination of of such a convoy.","This convoy is a response to what happened to the Mavi Marmara flotilla.

I have both Italian and Israeli citizenship.","I decided to be part of this convoy because being an Israeli I have always been interested in what is happening in Palestine and the reasons behind this long conflict.","I decided to stand with the people who are struggling and resisting. I don't believe this is a betrayal.","The Israeli government is the one betraying the cultural heritage of our people. Has the situation changed in Palestine?","Did you achieve any progress towards its liberation?","Things are getting worse.","Worse? Can it get any worse? After my last trip, I realise my efforts should be focused here in my country.","When you go to Palestine and decide to devote part of your life to support the Palestinian cause, you know you will go there often to see what has happened, meet with friends and support the resistance.","But the moment comes when you realise your efforts should be focused here. Because a lot of injustice that is so visible in Palestine is born here.","It started here 60 years ago when Israel was created with complicity in the occupation of Palestine.","Then with the international community's support of Israel's politics and allowing it impunity.","As well as all the military aid and economic trade guaranteed by Europe and the West in general.

It's compiled by the Palestine Forum. It's on the conference about Zionism we held in Rome in November.","It has always been taboo to talk about Zionism. But the conference broke this taboo. Thanks to the contributions of scholars who enriched the event with their research.","For example, comparing anti-Zionism to anti-Semitism. A concept we have always rejected.","It also discussed the one-state solution and the political ideology of Zionism as the main cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Only 5 Euros and you can help the resistance of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

We may only get limited results but they are important to us.","We try to make people understand the illegality of this matter.","That these settlements and their products are illegal. And that if we buy them, we are complicit in this illegality. If we succeed in this, it's important. I am not against Israel. Neither are we, but we support international law.","The Israelis should remember what the Germans did to them. They should stop doing something similar to the Palestinians. But it seems they forgot.","We're aware of the limits of our actions. We don't think we can change the world by distributing leaflets. But small things can make a difference.","We are not in the government. We don't have the power to change things. Each helps in their own way. But we are realistic about what we can achieve.","Had we not been so committed to this political struggle over the years, then perhaps the Palestine Forum wouldn't have lasted. In 1990, no sane person would have predicted that Nelson Mandela would become the president of South Africa.","So history is not written before it happens.","To hold out for what is right while others are giving up and accepting compromise solutions we rejected. It is a tough choice.

Those who refuse to serve in the army haven't been well-raised by their families. Otherwise, they would serve their homeland. What does our country give us in return? You devote three years of your life for what? 1% off from your bank loan? That's not enough. You should escape when asked to serve. My kids will never serve in the army.

It was everywhere.","I think that at that point, teenagers my age had a few different options. That the most common one was to try to ignore it as much as you can.","Another option was to kind of trying ask questions on what is going on.I joined an activity of an Israeli organization in the Occupied Territories in a Palestinian village. And in many ways, through that village, I began to understand what this word,Occupation, actually means.","[Avner Gvaryahu] The first time I ever entered a Palestinian house was towards the end of my first year of training. We went to the house in the middle of the night; you take away the cell phones. You put all the family in one room, you close the windows and the house is yours. The anger of the people, the eyes that looked at me and saw me as the epitome of evil is something that stayed with me. And there is violence. There is Palestinian violence like there is Jewish violence. But with that said there are people who aren't violent. [Avner Gvaryahu] And instead of encouraging those people to be non-violent, we did the opposite. RUTH HILLER NEW PROFILE.","It turns out that my ethics at home were subversive. Because we are media freaks, both of us, my husband and I. And we were watching Jordanian television so my children grew up seeing the first Intifada.","Which is something that was not seen by Israelis at all, they didn't even know it was happening. But my son said that when he saw those Israeli soldiers abusing Palestinians on television, when he was five or six, he didn't want to be a soldier already. SHIR GIVONI CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR.","My personal experience was very formative in my choice not to serve in the Israeli military. And that was that a friend of mine was killed, he was Palestinian. He was murdered on October 2000 while demonstrating. And that helped me to realize, to open my eyes and realize that in the name of security, my security, supposedly, terrible things are being done.","[Sahar Vardi] We decided to refuse as a group and we declared that we will refuse publicly.","We said \"our reasons to refuse are because we know what is happening on in the Occupation, we have seen this and we can't be a part of that system. I was probably sentenced six or seven times, altogether for about two months in military prison and another three months in detention and eventually I was released on mental health.","So technically I am crazy.","[Shir Givoni] To be anti-militarist or pacifist in Israel as a clear ideology is difficult. It is difficult to maintain it and to speak about it. It is looked down upon, it is perceived as not patriarchal and many people who do it are branded as traitors.","[Sahar Vardi] One of the first questions in every interview, work interview, would be -what did you do in the army, were you an officer, were you not? And this will definitely determine a lot of where you'll go in life.","Also the connections you receive in the army [Shir Givoni] A young person in Israel is 21,he has just come out of a system that has made him very small.

[New Delhi, India] WASSIM FAROUQ KHAN SHOP OWNER. We do mostly business with Israelis. Like 90% Israeli people are coming here because they are recommended from Israel. We started like back 24 years ago, that was the beginning of Israeli people coming to India after the army. It became more famous and they started talking about India, and then after all the young children after their army they were coming to India because it was really cheap. And they were just working for like 6 months or one year, saving the money.","And then coming back here, spending like six months, three months, four months and then flying back home.","You know Facebook? This is Facebook you see? I think it is amazing. Hundreds and hundreds of Israelis. Oh here, see. Two friends of mine that were here one year ago, maybe more.","[Wassim Farouq Khan] So the people they are together in the schools or in universities and especially from the army they know each other.

You have rules; you have to wake up very early. You don't want all this stuff here.","You just want to be cool. CHAIM NOY AUTHOR, 'VOICES OF ISRAELI BACKPACKERS'.","I think that the importance of the phenomenon of backpacking in Israel is that it allows a number of groups of Israelis, particularly young Israelis, to consolidate some kind of identity and some kind of shared experiences and shared practices that are shared among this group but not with other group. For instance ultra-orthodox Jews don't backpack, Palestinians living in Israel, Muslims or Christians, they don't backpack, they do other things at that age. So the group of backpackers is a way to do something that is physically outside the country and to relate to each other.","SHAI MICHEL FORMER SOLDIER.","I live in a Kibbutz. It is called Kibbutz Gadot. The Kibbutz is sometimes too much safe. You know what I am saying? It is like a small bubble, a warmy safe bubble.","[Shai Michel] The army is really maturing, it is really helping. But it is also, you know, you have strict rules and people telling you what to do.

There are many people with questions about life that are difficult to answer. Life in Israel is difficult politically and economically. So many people come here.","[Bhagsu, India ] Dharamkot, is I think Israeli people call it small Tel Aviv, because all the Israeli gather together there.","[Chaim Noy] Israeli backpackers gravitate to each other; they are attracted to each other. And this of course has consequences for the economics because if they gravitate to each other they create these micro-markets.","We have referred to it in some various publications as some kind of colonization, not in the hardcore sense of occupying the Gaza strip or Jericho. There are no tanks involved but there are a lot of sentiments involved. Many Israelis put Israeli flags or Israeli food. And it is in the public sphere. It is about being Israeli, it is about making the place an Israeli place. So when they travel they make this bubble and the people outside this bubble could be Palestinian slash Indians and so on.","YOAV STERN FORMER SOLDIER.","We've been in a unit whose specialty is against tanks. I can't say it was a great time, but there are some advantages in the army. You meet people from all over the country that you never would not meet without the army experience.","We have lots of common humor from this time you know. You're getting tougher for the rest of your life. That's also a kind of advantage.","[Shai Michel] I finished the army two years ago. I wasn't really trying to achieve something in the army. I just went like wherever they put me. They put me like in a tank crew. The only time you can say that I was in a war it was in Gaza. I've been like five days.","It is not really like the movies or like you imagine it will be if you need to be in this kind of situation. It is really really different and you are already into it and you are always preparing.","When it happens it just happens so quick you don't really. It's long time since I've thought about this kind of stuff.","It was good and bad 'cause I have a lot of good memories from the army. But also it was kind of hard times you know. Because you don't really do what you want to do.","I don't like wars or I don't like this situation where you have to constantly protect your borders or feel intimidated you know. I prefer peace and happiness. You don't have a lot of choice in Israel. You know it's kind ofyou have to do it. Because it is really a big part of Israeli society.","[Chaim Noy] I am not sure what are the relations between the army and the backpacking because if we would do an experiment and we have another State of Israel with no army, I still would think that many Israelis would backpack.","Because Israel is a very small country geographically, there is on the one side sea and on the other side Arab countries that are not usually in good relationships. But the fact is that many Israelis travel after doing the army. And what you can see is that they talk about the army and in many senses, they carry on their military identities and ways of behaving.","[Indian Cook] And mix it all I do like this? Ok. I love Indian food. At home I go to Indian restaurants and when I came here I decided to try it.","[Hadas Perez] I was very proud of myself to go to the army, especially because I love the country. So I was like I'm going to protect it, to do stuff for the country. My job wasn't something very stressful because it was kind of fun.","I was in charge of the education in the base. But my soldiers they had a tough job. I had a boyfriend that was a fighter.

And there is the reality of like you have to. Who do you think you are not to serve?","I did not like that. Its like I feel that each one has the right to choose if he wants to hold a gun or not. I did not want. And when I went there they basically saw that I am a lone girl. Which s a person who's family is not there.

We were feeling that this was the opportunity to get out of the country.","At that time I was a peace activist. There was a very big peace camp and I remember that one morning people from the Israeli army came to speak with us and said - look, we don't want to, we really support your peace camp, but we want to make the ground flat in order to build the wall, so you have to take your peace camp a few km away because we have to straighten the land for the wall.","For me it was a very big understanding that after they build the wall it is not going to get any better, now it would take years to break it.","[Yaeli Freespirit] I always say I am coming back.

They start to study German, they get some student visa and they can stay I haven't heard about an Israeli that was expelled from Berlin.","[Ofer Aderet] 20, 30 not to say 40 years ago, Berlin was some kind of an enemy.

SHAHAR LEVI, FORMER SERGEANT.","I feel that in Israel there is some sort of mechanism that makes you believe that what you are doing over there is necessary and you are protecting your country. And that there are certain points that you need to go through in your life as an Israeli citizen. And one of them is serving in the army.","There was one incident that didn't let me go, in a way. I couldn't really sleep at night. There was like a group of terrorist that broken to one of those checkpoints and they killed the Israeli soldiers. We didn't care about the motive.Oh yeah, we are going to kill people, that's cool So we went there and there were a few people in like uniforms, but the other people were not in uniforms, so you can never tell if they are soldiers or policemen, or just friends who came to visit.

Not only about those incidents.","You start to think about the other. The other, the Palestinian and their needs and their motives.","[Roy Rothfeld] Yeah, only like in the army did I come to bigger conclusions and got my opinion a bit stronger about Israel itself, about living here, if I want to live there, why don't I want live there, why I shouldn't live there.","For me here, it is quiet. I don't deal with news, with another terrorist was killed, another bomb went off, another Qassam fell, another soldier was kidnapped, this politician was found corrupt again, this one did that.","I don't have that right now in my life and that's a lot better for me, that's quiet for me.","[Gal Skolnik] I had several reasons to leave Israel. One was kind of a more social reason. I mean in Israel the society is still pretty traditional. On the other hand it was the Lebanon war and I had a really hard time coping with that because when I lived in Israel I was kind of trying to totally ignore all the politics, I was doing my very best.","Basically, you have this pressure on you all the time and then on top of the stuff that you know without even wanting if you actually turn the tv on and every night you see this serious person saying-today blablabla happened and blablabla, you are in danger.","I couldn't live like that. Only after like 2 years out of Israel was I actually able to read the newspaper again. GABRIEL S. MOSES, EXEMPTED FROM MILITARY SERVICE.","I think in Israel everybody is obsessed with this war on, war for survival. War to stop the Occupation, war to, I don't know, stop the zombie, Arab, Muslim enemy that threatens to destroy, so you kind of find yourself stuck in between saying, I just want to live my fucking life, I want to do other things.","So you find yourself an escapist, and just to be an escapist you have to fight for your right to do that. It is not easy there.","And then, being an escapist, turning your back on Israel, coming here, not wanting to deal with anything, all of a sudden you say; Wait a minute, now I am in Berlin, for this matter, and I can speak my mind, people want me to speak my mind, people are interested, I have a perspective, I can actually make some kind of a difference.","And then all of a sudden, you find yourself active from the outside because it doesn't demand so much effort as it did before.","[Gabriel S. Moses] Unless you are willing to be an active participant, an activist in Israel, willing to jeopardize your health and maybe sacrifice your life, for the sake of actively standing in Israel and refusing and fighting the Occupation, unless you are willing to take that responsibility on yourself, get the fuck out of there now, oppose it from afar, hold our breaths, say we don't like and disagree with all these stupid ideas that will come to flourishing.","Wait 200 years and then talk again.","[Gabriel S. Moses] There is a huge tendency of emigrating to Europe and these people are usually, usually the left wing youth or new generation which just don't see any reasonable resolution in the near future?","If the left just turned its back on this game called Israel and stopped playing it, there would be no mandate to even consider its legitimacy. The only people left there would be the ones who it would be so easy to object to that the machine would simply implode.","[Ofer Aderet] There are a lot of things which are wrong in Israel. The current government is mainly consisted of right wing nationalist ultra-orthodox. People are not satisfied by this government, people are afraid of the actions and of the choices of this government And maybe we will have to deal with yet another war.","So it is one of the factors but I am not sure if this is the only reason why people chose to leave a country and go abroad.","[Mor Dovart] It is too stressful there. And when I say stressful I don't mean like in a war zone kind of stressful way. I didn't feel the war zone so much and I on purpose detached myself from any kind of political. I don't read papers I don't watch television. It is the only way for me to be there, I cannot stand it any other way. And even though, the stress of the society is in every level of being.","[Roy Rothfeld] It is simply not worth it to go back to live there. Financial wise, even if I want to study in university, make a family. It doesn't really matter.","From the small fact that I have a European citizenship I get so many other choices and doors.","[Gabriel Moses] The funny thing about this book is that it is pretty much like a biography of what made me come to Berlin. How can we live this completely American lifestyle and facing the conflict every day, living next to it.","What does that mean? We live in the Middle East but we refuse to accept the fact that we are part of it. I think this pretty much indicates that there is an identity crisis in Israel.","[ISRAEL] ELIAHU BEN MOSHE DEMOGRAPHER & STATISTICIAN.","The dissatisfaction levels are growing tremendously in Israel. The demonstrations in the last summer and what is coming this summer are showing us that especially the middle class, a huge group, is very discontent with the situation.

Certainly they are not going to immigrate to the Third World. And we can't say for sure what will happen; one of the scenarios is that there will be an exodus.","The future of Israel, in my opinion, I am not sure where it actually goes.","I want to be really positive but I am afraid that things are gonna go in a bad way.","The future of Israel is hanging by a thread of the people in the government.","In Tel Aviv, things are better, but it is like a bubble here, so it is fun to live here but sometimes outside you see that there is a lot of poverty.","I hope to live here all my life, but I don't know if that's going to be a possibility, and that's it.","Both of my parents came from Italy to live here.

We talk about the city that used to be probably the biggest market city probably all around Israel, which is now pretty much empty.","We talk about more than 1800 stores that were closed, shut down; most of them welded shut by the army.","[Avner Gvaryahu] When Breaking the Silence talks about what is happening on the ground, and this is maybe the most important part, is the things that are legal by the army, legal by the government, but we see them as immoral. And when the orders are to enter a Palestinian house, that's when I want the discussion to start.","It is actually my first time in Hebron and I have heard of it all my life actually. I was only fed from the information that you hear on the news or in the newspaper and for someone who grew up in the Tel Aviv bubble, it is really shocking for me.","One of the goals of the stuff we are hearing about, it is really horrible stuff. It is to push Palestinians out of this area. It is happening now.

I don't take anything that the army taught me physically like military-wise, but I do take the years that I spent having to deal with myself as my main obstacle to overcome. I chose to see it like that, plain and simple. Israel is a crazy experiment. You try to create a reality where a modern country, that is supposed to be like any European country, but we are doing it in an environment that is not European and our mentality is not really European. So 60 years is very little time to create a real identity and when you think that what really holds a country together is fear… fear of not existing anymore then you kind of live in a mentality of - I have to do things quick because maybe there is no tomorrow."],["So help me change the world.

In the late 70's, there was a common bond of socialist ideology between Norway's Labour party and its namesake in Israel.","One of the key players in this special relationship was a prominent Labour Party member of Norway's Parliament, Johan Jorgen Holst.","[HANS LONGVA] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] Mr. Holst was the first person at the political level to meet Mr. Arafat. He was deputy minister and state secretary of the ministry of defence. He came to Beirut and travelled on to Israel in July I think it was in 79. He met with Yasser Arafat and Yasser Arafat invited the whole group to a very pleasant dinner. Mr. Holst had very close contact with Israelis and that aspect of Mr. Holst made him even more interesting to Mr. Arafat. Mr. Arafat's interest in Norway was really of its contacts with Israel.

[HANS LONGVA] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] Mr. Arafat after reflecting only for a few split seconds, he said I will have no objection to such a Norwegian guarantee to Israel, on one condition, when I need a secret back channel to Israel you provide it.","Yasser Arafat wanted the Norwegians to act as intermediary between himself and Israel. [HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] The Norwegians and the Norwegian government were just shocked to hear the message coming back from Arafat, so from 1979 and every year from there onwards the Norwegians tried to set up a secret back channel between the PLO and Israel, but Israel were absolutely not willing at all to listen to anything that the Norwegians could come up with from Arafat and the PLO.","In 1982 the PLO lost its base in Lebanon. Palestinian fighters were forced to depart following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon three months earlier. A US-brokered deal led to Arafat and his entourage moving to Tunisia.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] It was actually an invitation from Arafat to my predecessor as foreign minister Knut Frydenlund, and myself I have been defence minister and we went in 1982 for New Year's Eve with Arafat in Tunis at that time. Arafat asked us directly if we could help him getting a direct contact between PLO and the Israeli labour party, and I was at that time a member of the assembly of the socialist international, and it turned out to be a strong interest in the socialist international for trying to contribute to normalisation of the relationship between Palestinians and the Israelis. To help with his charm offensive, Arafat turned to senior PLO member Issam Sartawi to act as his main go-between. [THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] Arafat appointed Dr. Sartawi.

There was the socialist international had its assembly meeting in Albufeira in Portugal, and then there was some shooting suddenly, we rushed out in the lobby and there was Dr. Sartawi killed, shot down. Issam Sartawi lay where he'd been killed by a lone gunman who pumped 5 shots into his chest. It has never been clearly verified who ordered the assassination of Sartawi.","But the motive appears to be because he was talking to the Israelis on Arafat's behalf.

He told me that it wouldn't be easy.","He said Stoltenberg still supported Israel and so did his Labour party but our goal was to make them our friends.","The important thing was to give them intelligence.I gave it to the Foreign Ministry after Stoltenberg became Foreign Minister. Twenty years on, Thorvald Stoltenberg will not betray the secrecy of conversations between the PLO and Israel.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] We tried to prepare for contact and negotiations between the PLO authorities and the Israeli labour party, we started there, and we would very much like to try to follow up.","[Rawan] Whom were the people from the Israeli labour party that you were contacting? Mr. Shimon Peres or other people?","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] No, I promised never to tell anyone, I have not told anyone and I'm not even telling you. No, I mean, part of my success in life is not coming from what I say but from all the things I didn't say. In the mid 80s the Labour Party in Israel formed a coalition government with Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party.","Shamir gave a nod and a wink for Likud member Moshe Amirav to hold secret talks with Palestinian politician Faisal Al Husseini in Jerusalem.","Discussion centred on PLO recognition of Israel, autonomy on the West Bank; and a federal relationship with Jordan. The so-called Amirav-Husseini plan became a model for the subsequent Oslo Accords years later.","But all that was soon dwarfed by the outbreak of the first intifada a Palestinian uprising which took both Israel and the PLO by surprise.

This David and Goliath contest put the Israelis under great pressure. Time was now of the essence. In an exclusive for Al Jazeera, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry has released highly confidential documents that include a 1988, hand-delivered letter from Foreign Minister Stoltenberg to Israel Foreign Minister Peres. Stoltenberg wrote that \"Only by relieving itself of the burden of the occupied territories, can Israel succeed and prosper\". SHIMON PERES ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER 1986-1988.","I am ready to talk with any Palestinian that will renounce terror that will accept 242 and 338 and recognise Israel. Come and negotiate with us, then you can claim whatever you want. ANIS FAWZI QASIM PALESTINIAN LEGAL ADVISOR.","In 1988 the PLO put ona show around resolution 242.","Yasser Arafat actually wanted to accept 242.","But he didn't know how to sell it to Palestinians. So he said: We now have a state.","He had just created a virtual Palestinian state.","[YASSER ARAFAT] [CHAIRMAN, PLO] [1929-2004] We're establishing a Palestinian state on our Palestinian territories with Jerusalem as its capital.","[ANIS FAWZI QASIM] [PALESTINIAN LEGAL ADVISOR] When the PLO accepted Resolution 242 after fighting against it since it was issued in 1967 in reality it abandoned everything to do with the Palestinian cause.","[YASSER ARAFAT] [CHAIRMAN, PLO] [1929-2004] I accept all United Nations resolutions including 242 and 338, and I accept the international legality and who is against international legality?","[AHMAD TIBI] [MEMBER OF KNESSET] The PLO started to get closer to the international community that had boycotted and confronted it as a terrorist organisation.","Things changed. In 1988 Sweden mediated between the PLO and the United States. A public meeting was held in Stockholm.","[YASSER ARAFAT] [CHAIRMAN, PLO] [1929-2004] The PLO parliament, the Palestinian parliament, the PNC had accepted two states, Palestine state and Jewish state, between brackets Israel. In his speech to the UN General Assembly in Geneva in 1988, Arafat formally condemned terrorism.","[YASSER ABED RABBO] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] Abu Ammar's speech in Geneva was vague. Americans didn't like it.","He didn't directly say: I renounce terrorism.","They asked him to arrange a press conference the following day. As I remember, it was on December 14th, 1988.","They asked him to say clearly, in English: I, in the name of the PLO, renounce terrorism. But Abu Ammar didn't know how to say it. So he started to say: I announce terrorism and the journalists corrected him.","[YASSER ARAFAT] [CHAIRMAN, PLO] [1929-2004] As for terrorism, I announce it Renounce, renounce Yesterday in no uncertain terms, and yet I repeat for the record, I repeat for the record, that we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, all forms of terrorism. Arafat had accepted the Israeli terms to start negotiations.","In December 1988, PLO leader Yasser Arafat known to his colleagues as Abu Ammar - publicly renounced violence.","Over the years, Norway had discreetly been talking to the PLO.","With Arafat renouncing violence, Norway was now ready to pay him an official visit at the PLO headquarters in Tunis.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] Norwegian [1989] We have a strong relationship with Israel.","We asked the PLO to recognise Israel and renounce terrorism.","This is what Arafat did.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] It was the first time a Norwegian foreign minister visited PLO. It was definitely a successful visit because it was a breakthrough for official contacts.","[HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] The same foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg, the father of the prime minister of Norway today, he went on a mission to Arafat in Tunis in 1989, and at that meeting they had a secret part that no one knew about. The Norwegians worked with Arafat on creating a channel of communication between the PLO and Israel. Far from public scrutiny.","[HANS LONGVA] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] Mr. Arafat first time he explained how he saw contacts with Israel being established. And the idea of using a Norwegian research institution was the idea of Yasser Arafat which he outlined during that meeting.","[HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] They haven't planned or decided which research institute in Norway, but they agreed that that would be a good cover and they also agreed that the Norwegian ministry of foreign affairs should pay for it all. That was also agreed in the document. FAFO was a think tank in Oslo founded by the Trade Unions and connected to Norway's Labour Party.","It was chosen by the Norwegian Foreign Minister as the perfect host for secret talks between Israelis and Palestinians.","Its Director was Terje Rd-Larsen.","He would go on to become a key figure in the negotiations that led to the Oslo Accords.","With funding from the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, in 1989 FAFO started to undertake research in the Middle East.","Its first study examined the living conditions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. TERJE ROD-LARSEN DIRECTOR OF FAFO.","FAFO conducted this survey in the Palestinian Territories in 1989.","MONA JUUL NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT.","The living condition of young people growing up under the Intifada. What kind of effect on them, maybe more on the sort of mental psychological effect of growing up in such sort of a violent environment. [Rawan] But then it was more a socio-economic study?","[MONA JUUL] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] It turned out because that was sort of the speciality of FAFO so it turned up to be a little more socio-economic, unemployment all these kinds of indicators of social economic life. [Rawan] So who were the researchers that worked on this project from Norway?","[MONA JUUL] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] Ya, there were many, and one of them that sort of was heading that special service was Marianne Heiberg who was the wife of, he wasn't at the time but he later became the Norwegian foreign minister Johan Jrgen Holst. I was working in the sort of what we call the foreign minister's cabinet or the secretariat, my husband was with FAFO, Jan Egeland was the state secretary.","[JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] Mona Juul and I had studied political science in the university. We had been skiing together. We had been to university camps together. And her husband Terje Rd-Larsen I also knew from his work as an academic and his work in creation of FAFO the trade union think-tank. So these were my friends already when I became the deputy of Thorvald Stoltenberg in the ministry of foreign affairs.","[HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] It's often difficult for foreigners to understand that Norway is a very, very small country, and the Labour party has ruled Norway for most of the post war period, so you have connections. You are almost families married together within the Labour party, like almost we sometimes call it the royal labour party because they are like a dynasty. This dynasty was very tight-knit.","Foreign Minister Stoltenberg appointed Jan Egeland as his deputy and Mona Juul as Egelande's Secretary. She was married to Terje Rd-Larsen, the Director of FAFO. Stoltenberg's sister-in-law was Marianne Heiberg who worked in FAFO. She was married to Defence Minister Johan Jrgen Holst. This made Holst and the Foreign Minister Stoltenberg brothers-in-law. Holst himself later became Norway's Foreign Minister. This extended political family became the Norwegian team in the secret Israeli-PLO talks. ARNE ORUM NORWEGIAN RESEARCHER.","They could use that research institution as a front for diplomatic effort to facilitate peace talks between the two parties and do that in all secrecy. [Rawan] You are very critical about this, why?","[ARNE ORUM] [NORWEGIAN RESEARCHER] I think researchers should not usually be, take on two hats or be in double roles. In Tel Aviv, another research institute was also acting as a cover for communication between Israelis and the Palestinians. This was the Economic Cooperation Foundation set up by Israeli Labour Party MP Yossi Beilin.","[RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] The NGO that we were leading, Hirschfeld and myself. An NGO which was created earlier by Beilin and Hirschfeld. We were able to go between the two sides in Jerusalem and pass messages and come with ideas and even bring the two sides unofficially together under our umbrella of an NGO. YOSSI BEILIN ISRAELI LABOUR PARTY.","I was involved with talking to the Palestinian side for many years in a very informal way mainly with people like Hanan Ashrawi and Faisal Husseini from east Jerusalem with whom it was easy to talk. By 1989, with the Palestinian intifada in its second year, there were few signs of hope for peace. Hundreds of Palestinians had been killed and thousands detained. The United States - under President George Bush started to increase the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.","[YITZHAK SHAMIR] [ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ] [1986-1992] The peace process will be composed of two stages. First stage will be interim conditions, and this will include a full autonomy etcetera. The second stage will be direct negotiations without any preconditions between Israel, the Palestinian Arabs and some Arab countries if they will join the negotiations.","[YITZHAK SHAMIR] [ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER] [1986-1992] We are ready to embark immediately on peace talks, for that purpose we are ready to hold elections in the administered territories that will produce a democratically chosen representative leadership of the Palestinians. Everything changed in the region when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The United States led a coalition of nations that retaliated against Iraqi forces. GEORGE BUSH US PRESIDENT 1989-1993.","[1991] Just two hours ago, allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait. These attacks continue as I speak. Arafat rejected a military solution to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. This proved a costly decision.","[HANS LONGVA] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] Before the Gulf war, PLO received big financial support from the Arab gulf states. After the war because of Yasser Arafat's support to Saddam Hussein that financial support disappeared. They came out of that war very weakened. And I think frankly that was also one of the reasons why the Israelis were more interested in discussing with them after the Gulf war than before. We of course have close relations with the United States of America. They are an ally, they are a friend, and we made no secret of the contacts with the PLO obviously and we shared some of our assessment based on our communication with PLO with our American friends, yes.","In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War the United States and the Soviet Union co-hosted a peace conference in the Spanish capital of Madrid. JAMES BAKER US SECRETARY OF STATE 1989-1992.","We have an opportunity, I think a real opportunity to see Arabs, Arab states sitting down face to face in direct negotiations with Israel.","[ANIS FAWZI QASIM] [PALESTINIAN LEGAL ADVISOR] All the conditions for Madrid were drafted by Shamir and the Israeli government and they vetoed PLO representation.","The delegation had to come from the occupied Palestinian territories.","[YASSER ABED RABBO] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] Arafat fought strongly against the Israeli conditions but lost.","Some Arab states didn't want us at Madrid, preferring to isolate us.","Others suggested we accept the conditions to get a foot in the door.","We agreed to take part but through a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.","MAHMOUD ABBAS PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION.","[1991] Our number one priority is to be at the Madrid conference. The Israelis laid out a fixed negotiating position.","[YITZHAK SHAMIR] [ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER] [1986-1992] We are the only people who have lived in the land of Israel without interruption for nearly 4000 years. Haidar Abdel-Shafi led the Palestinians within the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation at the talks. HAIDER ABDEL-SHAFI PALESTINIAN DELEGATE.","Palestinian Jerusalem, the capital of our homeland and future state, defines Palestinian existence, past, present and future. The settlements must stop now, territory for peace is a travesty when territory for illegal settlement is official Israeli policy and practice.","The three-day conference ended with plans for further bilateral and multilateral negotiations between Israel and the Arabs. Documents released after the conference reveal that Shamir thought Madrid a success; and that James Baker said that the US did not support an independent Palestinian state.","[ANIS FAWZI QASIM] [PALESTINIAN LEGAL ADVISOR] It was clear from the way the Israelis behaved that the talks could last 20 years.","They just didn't seem to care. Israelis who celebrated the end of Hanukkah in Washington arrived 5 days late. An attempt to make it clear to the United States that they are here on their own terms and won't respond to pressure. After Madrid, negotiations moved to Washington DC. ELYAKIM RUBINSTEIN ISRAELI DELEGATION.","We sincerely feel that our ideas are fully in conformity with the framework of this process, as it was laid ahead and we speak with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. ABDELSALAM AL MAJALI JORDANIAN-PALESTINIAN DELEGATION.","Hello, good evening everybody, we met like we met in the morning, the heads of delegations. We discussed the matter of procedures, and we could not reach yet an agreement.","[HAIDER ABDEL-SHAFI] [PALESTINIAN DELEGATE] The Israeli government shifted unabashed to the intransigent and openly declared position of claiming all Palestinian territory, not conceding anything for the Palestinians and refusing to recognise their unity, the unity of the Palestinians inside and outside.","[ANIS FAWZI QASIM] [PALESTINIAN LEGAL ADVISOR] The problem that completely preoccupied Haidar Abdel-Shafi at all our formal and informal talks was the Israeli settlements.","[HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] And the Israelis, they were more and more angry about this very old calm distinguished man talking about settlements. He said how can we have back Palestine if it's settlements all over, so he had a much more, and the delegation there, had a much more straight forward approach to peace. For the Palestinians, negotiator Haidar Abdel Shafi kept the focus of his agenda on one burning issue: the illegal Israeli settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories. By 1991 the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip exceeded 100,000.","[MAHMOUD ABBAS] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] There's no doubt that the settlements are crucial for the peace process.","By continuing to build what we think are illegal settlements Israel suggests that it doesn't want peace.","[MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI] [PALESTINIAN NATIONAL INITIATIVE] With the talks at stalemate, Israel decided to look for a different route.","[RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] I would say one of the most important messages that we got in our almost daily contacts with Ashrawi and Husseini and Nuseibah and Ziad, all the Palestinian leaders, if PLO will not be involved, there won't be any progress, and more so Ashrawi and Husseini told us very clear.","[Rawan] Hanan Ashrawi and Faisal Husseini [RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] Hanan Ashrawi and Faisal Husseini, they told us something very very clear. If you would like to have an agreement with the Palestinians, partner who can make concessions, there's only one address and that's the PLO. FAISAL AL HUSSEINI PALESTINIAN POLITICIAN.","If the Israelis would like to negotiate with the Palestinians so they must negotiate with the representative of the Palestinians. The representative of the Palestinians is the PLO.","HANAN ASHRAWI PALESTINIAN POLITICAN. If they disqualify the PLO then they're not going to have any Palestinian to talk to.","[YASSER ABED RABBO] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] The Washington talks were going nowhere. Delegations came and went but nothing was agreed.","So if we started separate secret negotiations with the Israelis we'd have nothing to lose because it wouldn't ultimately be binding. The PLO again approached Norway to open a new and secret channel with the Israelis. In February of 1992, senior PLO official Ahmed Qurei known as Abu Ala'a - travelled to Oslo. [OMAR KITMITTO] [PALESTINIAN DIPLOMAT] Abu Ala'a was in Sweden and we went to the Foreign Ministry to meet them.","[Rawan] Who did you meet at the Foreign Ministry?","We met Stoltenberg, the Norwegian Foreign Minister and I remember Jan Egeland was there.","[JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] PLO starts to send signals to us here, Abu Ala' comes that we Norway could become their link to Israel if Israel was interested. Then came Basem Abu Sharif and he was even more explicit and said: I am talking directly, I have a message straight from the top, Yasser Arafat, Norway should try to do this. And it has to be directly linked with PLO Tunis leadership only.","The minutes of their secret meeting in Oslo reveal that Bassam Abu Sharif told the Norwegians that if there were peace, \"the PLO would influence the Arab World to stop the boycott of Israel\". [JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] Of course it takes two to Tango; we did not have the Israeli side. I had met Yitzhak Rabin before he was elected, on one of my missions to Israel.","[Rawan] On April 1992 [JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] In April 92, we met Rabin. He came for a breakfast in the Norwegian embassy and we asked him what is your approach to the Palestinians, and he said I'm keen to see some kind of a negotiated settlement. In 1992, the Israeli Labour Party led by Yitzhak Rabin won the general election. Rabin continued Israel's policy of settlement building. In public, he spoke optimistically of progress in the peace negotiations.","[YITZHAK RABIN ] [ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER ] [1992-1995] I believe that within six to nine months, it will be possible to reach an agreement with the Palestinian delegation about the establishment of autonomy. What will be the first and most important task for a government for you and your colleagues?","[SHIMON PERES] [ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTER] [1992-1995] To renew the peace process and go straight ahead into the autonomy implementation. Shimon Peres was appointed Foreign Minister. Yossi Beilin here on the left - was appointed his Deputy; and Uri Savir on the right their General Manager. Beilin was given the green light to start the secret direct negotiations with the PLO in Norway.","[YOSSI BEILIN] [ISRAELI LABOUR PARTY] The point of Norway was because Norway was out of the EU, it had independent foreign policy. We had meetings with Terje Rd-Larsen, with his people. TERJE ROD-LARSEN PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL PEACE INSTITUTE. , We had many many meetings but very little came out of it. But then I started to understand much better the mind set of both parties. RON PUNDAK ISRAELI HISTORIAN Beilin actually told the Norwegians that it's good that they will make contact with Hirschfeld, later I joined, in order to facilitate. In order to, that you'll have two NGOs, two non-governmental dialogue. This was the, and we met, Hirschfeld met Larsen before. I met him April and later. We found a brother in a way. A man who thinks very similar to our way of thinking. His wife was the head of the office of the minister’s deputy, and second is the minister and the deputy were very close friends of Larsen. All of them from the labour party. Old friends. YOSSI BEILIN ISRAELI LABOUR PARTY Mr. Stoltenberg was the foreign minister. I knew him very well and he was very very enthusiastic about the process. HANS LONGVA NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT Mr. Stoltenberg met Shimon Peres, was the minister of ...airs of Israel in New York at the opening of the general assembly in September, and on the basis of those contacts, the follow up contacts, Thorvald Stoltenberg assessment was that the time was right to follow up the suggestion of Mr. Arafat. ARNE ORUM NORWEGIAN RESEARCHER The PLO and Arafat were exactly weak enough, so this was exactly the time that the Israelis should chose to start negotiating with PLO outside. RON PUNDAK ISRAELI HISTORIAN PLO before Oslo was almost dead. HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN Israel was the strong power. And Israel decided who to talk to, when to talk, the terms of the negotiations. They told Norway that Norway could like it or dislike it. They could do as Israel say or go home. COMM A new and self-confident Israeli government... ...and a PLO still cast as outsiders by the world community. They were now on the secret road to the Oslo Accords.... But much would need to happen before the diplomatic finale on the White House lawn."],["The negotiations leading here were secret and mediated by Norwegian politicians.","In September 1993, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, also known as Abu Ammar, shook hands on the White House lawn. The negotiations leading here were secret and mediated by Norwegian politicians.","The talks were conducted through shadow organisations to maintain secrecy and cover everyone's tracks.","The Oslo trade union think tank, FAFO, did a study in the early 90s on the living conditions of Palestinians in occupied territories. But it was a cover for these secret negotiations between the PLO and Israel.

Abu Ammar did not hold back any answers.","In this house a hundred kilometres from Oslo, near the Swedish border, two Israelis, three Palestinians and four Norwegians met three times in early 1993. These gatherings led to what later became known as the Oslo Accords.","[RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] The Oslo negotiations actually started with two Israelis, one of them is me, the other is Dr. Yair Hirschfeld.

If we needed that somebody would speak with foreign minister Christopher, state department, so the same man who brought us coffee would also be able to speak with Christopher, which is from our point of view was a classical environment, allowing us to dictate what should be their role, and it was perfect, it was the best.","In his book: The New Middle East, Shimon Peres wrote The Norwegians were a gift from Heaven.\" After the first round of talks and the Israelis began drafting what they called a 'Declaration of Principles'.","[RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] The second meeting which took place some three, four weeks later was from my point of view the most crucial meeting to make this meeting of two sides into a channel.

The Israelis decided that after 18 months the Washington talks were not going to reach agreement.

The Palestinian delegation's position had always been firm and clear.","But they didn't know the other negotiations were taking place.","[RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] Nobody knew anything about the channel and whenever there was some knowledge we immediately jointly were able to quiet it.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] We were of course criticised for the secrecy but without the secrecy it would not have worked at all. The Norwegian prime minister announcing the departure of her foreign minister, about to begin a new role as UN peace maker.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] I have many friends in former Yugoslavia. I hope that I will be able to contribute to a peaceful solution.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] I didn't really want to go to Balkan, and that was because I would like to see the Oslo process through because I was then very optimistic. Stoltenberg's successor as Foreign Minister was his brother-in-law, former defence minister Johan Jrgen Holst. Holst had been a strong supporter of Israel since the early 70s.","[JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] Johan Jrgen Holst was very keen. He asked for us to do whatever we could to make progress, he had already had signals from Terje Rd-Larsen and Mona Juul who of course knew him well through Marianne Heiberg, his wife who worked at FAFO.","[THORVALD STOLTENBERG] [FORMER NORWEGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER] He knew enough and I briefly informed him, but I was also sending him messages when he asked, and he did some in the beginning. I sent it from Balkan to him, but he was by and large involved.","[HANS LONGVA] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] This channel was upgraded in May, that was after Mr. Holst had become minister of foreign affairs. The Israelis also introduced a new face at the Oslo talks, their General Manager at the Foreign Ministry, Uri Savir. URI SAVIR ISRAELI DIPLOMAT. When foreign minister Peres asked me to look at this document and then potentially participate at this channel, I was very glad. I think that something good had happened to the PLO. They finally began to see that the armed struggle will lead them nowhere, that actually their biggest enemy is their biggest alley and partner, Israel.","[MONA JUUL] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] They met for the first time up at a small cottage up at Holmenkollen which is a famous ski jump and ski area, just right outside Oslo. Abu Alaa' slept at Holmenkollen Park Hotel which is a hotel next door.","[Rawan] And Uri Savir, where did he stay?","[MONA JUUL] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] I think he stayed in our flat that night, that's right, that's right. Ya.","[URI SAVIR] [ISRAELI DIPLOMAT] I'm a big believer in secret negotiations, so at the end the public knows the outcome and not the intermediary concessions. And therefore we knew we had about two, three months, and in three months we did it. In this hotel near Oslo, Uri Savir used his first meeting with the Palestinians to stress three, deal-breaking Israeli conditions. First, no negotiations over Jerusalem or the return of refugees. Second, no UN involvement or international arbitration.","And third: that the public-facing Washington talks continue in parallel with the secret negotiations. The Palestinians accepted all three.","[MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI] [PALESTINIAN NATIONAL INITIATIVE] Savir squeezed even more concessions from the Palestinians.","He was from Peres' Foreign Ministry.","Then they said Rabin's office had to be involved and Joel Singer arrived.","He was really tough.","[JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] Joel Singer's contribution was to ask hundreds of questions on the other side to really understand what this would mean. How PLO would treat this. What would be them as a counterpart. They I think felt it was quite offensive in one way to be interrogated like that.","[MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI] [PALESTINIAN NATIONAL INITIATIVE] Some questions were traps like whether the Palestinians would allow settlers in areas they administered.","When it was agreed the Israelis were euphoric because it allowed the Israeli settlements to continue.","At the end Singer wrote: I wasn't surprised to get a 100 answers to my 100 questions.","But I was shocked not to get a single Palestinian question in return.","Lawyer Joel Singer acted as legal advisor to the Israeli Ministry of Defence. Following his first meeting with the Palestinians, he headed to Vienna to meet Peres [URI SAVIR] [ISRAELI DIPLOMAT] Shimon Peres came back from a dinner and Yoel wakes up and he looks at him. He says Yoel. He said: \"Foreign minister if we don't make an immediate deal with these people we are complete idiots.\" Five months later, in July 1993 in the resort of Halvorsbol, Singer presented the amended 'declaration of principles' document, setting out the details of Palestinian autonomy. It clearly stated that autonomy wouldn't include the settlements or military zones or Jerusalem; and that Israel would remain in charge of security and the protection of settlers.","[RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] So what Joel Singer did, he deconstructed it, made it into a document with legal aspect. The Palestinians one should understand were shocked because suddenly all things that they were saying but they were afraid to see them were black and white, and it was a tough day for them. The Palestinian delegation saw the serious implications of Singer's document and so returned to Tunis to confer with the PLO leadership.","[URI SAVIR] [ISRAELI DIPLOMAT] Arafat wanted to enlarge the Jericho area into the Jordan river so he would have certain hold on his relationship with Jordan. And that was quite an argument.","Then certain authorities over the council etcetera. And like in every negotiations comes the end game. The end game was conducted by Holst going to Tunis. [Tunis] [Johan Jorgan Holst] [AHMED QUREI] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] Holst came to Tunis to meet Abu Ammar and I attended that same meeting.","He left saying that Arafat was more enthusiastic about a deal than Abu Alaa' or Abu Mazen or any of the others.","So Arafat was very serious and Holst confirmed that to the Israelis.","[MONA JUUL] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] It was very, very useful then to have the opportunity to discuss these issues also directly with Arafat, and we were then sort of also able to communicate that to the Israelis. [HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] After these meetings with Arafat. Terje Rd-Larsen and Mona Juul went back to Jerusalem to the whole Israeli team and told the Israelis everything that Arafat had said and done.","[Rawan] And even a letter written by Holst himself.","[HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] Not even a letter, a letter and I think 11 pages with minutes from the meeting, giving the letter and the minutes word by word of Arafat's opinions, where he thought he can have something and do something.","All this was given to the Israelis.","[MONA JUUL] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] It was more sort of a judgement on where the Palestinians and Arafat in particular were on sort of the whole idea, reaching an agreement. Johan Jorgan Holst was very much a writing man. He always wrote things and he wrote almost everything himself. I mean working for him was very difficult than working with other ministers, because every time when he went to meetings the first thing on the plane he sat down and wrote down his impressions, so that was the way he worked, so it was very much a personal letter. [Rawan] So this letter was handed to Mr. Peres at that time.","[MONA JUUL] [NORWEGIAN DIPLOMAT] Ya Ya. Extracts of these letters later appeared in personal memoirs but no official record of their contents has ever been found in the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. In the secret negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel, Norway's role as mediator was key; but those involved were careful always to cover their tracks.","[HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] In the new books of Shimon Peres, foreign minister of Israel, Yossie Beilin, deputy foreign minister of Israel, Uri Savir, chief negotiator of Israel and so on, there were many paragraphs quoting from secret Norwegian documents, letters that they for instance had received from the Norwegian foreign minister, but still in the Norwegian ministry of foreign affairs no copies, nothing. From the period of 20th of Jan when it started until the end of August it was nothing. It was no documents, no memos just nothing from what had actually been going on in this secret Oslo project.","[HILDE HENRIKSEN WAAGE] [NORWEGIAN HISTORIAN] We found out that Terje Rd-Larsen, he has admitted that he has many of these secret documents himself and he refuses to give them back to the Norwegian state.","[TERJE ROD-LARSEN] [PRESIDENT INTERNATIONAL PEACE INSTITUTE] To do secret negotiations through a ministry is very difficult because there has to be written reports, lots of people will have to know about it. If you do it with a research institute you can have just a tiny group of people and there is no duty to report in writing, so this is also how the secrecy was kept.","The secret Holst-Peres conversations led them to believe that the time had come to finalise a deal. Peres headed to Stockholm to resolve the outstanding points on the phone.","[RON PUNDAK ] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] At the castle, in Sweden we are opening actually a hot line.","[Rawan] Who was there?","[RON PUNDAK] [ISRAELI HISTORIAN] Peres invites the Norwegian foreign minister and Terje Larsen and Mona Juul to be the go between, they are sitting in the room together with Joel Singer. Arafat and his team are in Tunis.","[YASSER ABED RABBO] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] On the eve of the Oslo deal in 1993 Abu Ammar called us to join him immediately.","He'd got news from Abu Alaa' and the Oslo team.","Abu Mazen and I weren't on very good terms with Abu Ammar because PLO resources were thin.","He'd cut spending on our accommodation, phone bills, everything.","But we forgot all our differences and went to meet him.","[Rawan] Who was present in Tunis?","[YASSER ABED RABBO] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] There were four or five of us.","Abu Ammar, Abu Mazen, Abu Alaa', Hassan Asfour and there was a Lebanese friend, Mohsen Ibrahim, too.","Abu Ammar was talking to Holst.","[URI SAVIR] [ISRAELI DIPLOMAT] Holst was talking to Yasser Arafat, and Peres could hear on the phone for the first time Arafat and his people and this solved six out of seven issues. All the outstanding issues from the six rounds of secret negotiations in June and July in Norway were resolved in this seven hour phone call between Stockholm and Tunis.","In his book, Mahmoud Abbas later recalled: \"A seven hour phone call ended the conflict of the 20th century The Palestinian people took the first steps towards freedom and emancipation. That call achieved what couldn't be done in 20 months of futile negotiations in Washington.\"","[YASSER ABED RABBO] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] The Oslo Accord didn't stipulate an end to the occupation that settlements should halt or mention an independent Palestinian state.","It left options open with the excuse that they needed to convince their leaders of this project including Rabin specifically.","Being objective, if agreements are vague they tend to favor the stronger party.","The weaker party always seeks clarity.","[JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] If you have a strong and a weak party, the strong party is the strongest, this is the reality of the world.","And if then you have a strong party that is backed by the superpower of the world, United States, it makes that strong party even stronger. In this government guesthouse in Oslo, and in absolute secrecy, the 'declaration of principles' was initialled by both sides.","The secret signing was filmed by Norwegian Intelligence; and the footage later used in a documentary for public TV in Norway.","[JAN EGELAND] [NORWEGIAN LABOUR PARTY] Abu Alaa' being much more emotional than we had thought.

It was what he called the decay of the PLO leadership against the cunning of Israel.","[ANIS FAWZI QASIM] [PALESTINIAN LEGAL ADVISOR] What had happened was that Israel had simply moved responsibility for civil administration from the military to the Palestinians.","ABDUL SATTAR QASSEM PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE.","I'm now talking to a Palestinian administrator rather than an Israeli but the Palestinian is just a go-between.","[MUSTAFA BARGHOUTI] [PALESTINIAN NATIONAL INITIATIVE] Oslo was the greatest idea Israel ever had.","It let them continue the occupation, without paying any of the costs.","After the news of the secret Oslo negotiations had been leaked, it was inevitable that the two sides would bring things into the public arena.","Israel started to use the Norwegians to demand further concessions.","[YASSER ABED RABBO] [PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION] They made a one-sided proposal that we'd recognize Israel but they wouldn't recognize a Palestinian state.","But they would recognize the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.","To complete the mutual recognition, Israel stipulated that the PLO not only renounce terrorism, but also commit to prevent all forms of violence and terrorism; and it encouraged the Palestinians to have a normal relationship with Israel from now on.","Arafat agreed; and Holst flew to Tunis to witness Arafat signing these letters.

This is exactly what you see.","It's a period which Israel had intensively and effectively used in order to over triple the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank and to change completely, irreversibly, the West Bank landscape.","Another good example is of course the Bypass system which is just under us. This whole Bypass system was created after Oslo.","There were the years between 1993 and 2000, which the Israeli population growth in the west bank reached the fastest pace of growth ever.

He was not the simple minded soldier that he pretended to be; but he was a highly sophisticated politician who imposed on the Arabs, Britain's partition plan. There was a meeting between Ernest Bevin, the Labour government's foreign secretary and Tawfik Abu al-Huda, the Jordanian prime minister who was accompanied by Glubb Pasha who also acted as an interpreter. Bevin asked Abu Al-Huda 'what do you plan to do?' and Abu Al-Huda said 'we plan to send the Arab Legion to protect and keep the Arab part of Palestine', and Bevin said 'that seems the sensible thing to do but don't go and invade the Jewish part.","[Dr Ilan Pappe] On second of May, they the British officers of the Jordanian Army and the officers of the Haganah met for the last time to find a solution for Jerusalem, but it did not work.

That is how the West Bank was actually created.","[Dr Mahdi Abdul Hadi] Glubb Pasha adhered to this agreement, and ordered his forces to evacuate the cities of Lod and Ramleh. On July the 10th, the Jordanian forces pulled out of Lod and Ramleh. Clear of Jordanian forces the two cities were bombed by what was now the Israeli air force. The Israeli army then moved in, commanded by Colonel Moshe Dayan In Lod alone, over 100 Palestinians were massacred inside the Dahmash mosque. More than 50,000 Palestinians were expelled from the two cities. Walking without provisions in the summer heat, many died of exhaustion in what has since become known as the ‘Lydda Death March’. Despite the presence of the Arab forces in Palestine, atrocities were still committed. Yet few are well documented. Israeli historian Theodor Katz submitted a thesis claiming the Israelis had committed a massacre in the coastal village of Tantura. “They closed all the four sides of Tant...o said that my rifle is somewhere next to my house was taken like this, with a rope, to his house by two or four people and the next thing was that the rifle came out and the man did not. And those who answered there on the beach that they had no rifle were directly shot in their head. Now this is not a Palestinian story. This is a story of a Jew who was a lawyer in the state of Israel many years. The Palestinian men of Tantoura were taken to the cemetery and there they were put in lines and they were told to begin digging and whenever a line finished digging, they were shot and fell down inside.” “There was no worry on the Zionist leadership’s side that the soldiers would fail to understand what was expected of them because they had already dehumanized the Palestinians in their thinking and perception long before the operations themselves began.” The state of Israel was formed through blood and fire yet this was neither the start nor the end of suffering for the Palestinians."],["","For Palestinians, that year is the Nakba or Catastrophe when hundreds of thousands were forced out of their homes.","For Israelis, that year marks the creation of the state of Israel.","As a filmmaker, and as a Palestinian this documentary series was my way to understand the events of the past that are still shaping the present.","From early 1948, Jewish paramilitary forces began to seize more land in Palestine.","By the end of July, more than 400,000 Palestinians had been forced to flee their homes.","Their plight as refugees had just started..

That would change with the creation of The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising – the UNLU.","QAIS ABDUL KARIM","THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE","The UNLU was made up of three factions: Fatah, the Popular Front and the Democratic Front.

Demonstrations happened on Fridays. We distributed thousands of leaflets across Gaza. People’s participation began participating more than before. We told those working in Israel to go on strike.

It announced the creation of Hamas","YAHYA AL ABADSA","HAMAS","The head of the University met with the head of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Gaza. We decided to show support for our people. We agreed the Islamic student bloc inside the University would help initiate campaigns inside and outside of the University.","YASIR ZAATRAH","WRITER AND POLITICAL ANALYST","Some people called the First Intifada the ‘Revolution of the Mosques’. The mosques were the birthplace of the Palestinian resistance movement. There was a secular force, but the Islamic influence was felt, even within Fatah.","BASSAM AL SALHI","PALESTINIAN PEOPLE’S PARTY","The Intifada grew. It gathered support from other countries, factions, trade unions, businesses and universities. Business owners were asked to take part in strikes. The Intifada aimed to remove the Israeli army from the cities and camps. It ultimately wanted to establish a Palestinian state and end the occupation. Popular committees encouraged direct participation in the movement.","I remember a leaflet published in Gaza saying: ‘Did you scare an Israeli soldier today? Did you participate in creating popular committees? Or take part in social solidarity?'","Then it included some task that needed to be done. This had a direct impact on people.","There was no longer any doubt about what was happening: a national uprising against a colonial power that had been ruling Palestinians through military occupation since 1967.","Palestinian workers were a powerful force for the Intifada. Half the workers in Gaza and a third of those in the occupied West Bank traveled to Israel every day to earn a living.","RAJI SOURANI","PALESTINIAN CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS","On weekends the streets would be crowded with Palestinian workers. Most workers from Gaza had jobs in Israel.","The Intifada in the Gaza Strip had exploded. It just needed organization","JAMAL ZAKKOUT","FMR UNIFIED NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THE UPRISING","In the West Bank it was more difficult. There was already a Palestinian political structure in place. So resistance movements couldn’t have as much power. We had to tell people there were groups to lead them, with a plan to meet their immediate needs on one hand and achieve a collective national goal.","Without coherent leadership, Palestinians began to worry the Intifada wouldn’t last.","Increasingly, the exiled leadership of the PLO seemed out of touch with what was unfolding on the ground. New political forces -- the UNLU and the Islamic movements -- had influence within the Palestinian territories, but no clout internationally.","It was unclear how the simmering tensions between the PLO and the Intifada leaders could be resolved.","The Intifada had begun but nobody was quite sure how – or if – it would end.","Palestinians don't want occupation. They want self- determination to return to their land and settle. It's simple and united.","When the Palestinian Intifada began in December 1987, it captured the world’s attention.","Israel had never encountered anything like the Intifada before. Military commanders had to decide how to deal with an uprising they saw as a threat to their national security.","In this film, we revisit some of the people captured in photographs taken by George Azar, a Lebanese-American journalist.","During the Intifada, Amram Mitzna was an Israeli commander.","AMRAM MITZNA","COMMANDER, ISRAELI CENTRAL COMMAND 87 – 90","The surprise was that it spread from north to south and from east to west, Everyplace, you could see the same system, which was not actually a system, but the same behavior, Children, women and of course young even kids demonstrating, with many many people participating in this shouting, yelling, throwing stones and sometimes Molotov cocktails, that challenging our forces was we couldn’t use all the powers that we could have had.","You couldn’t let them rule, or control the main roads in the cities or the main roads between the villages.","So the biggest challenge was to brief our soldiers how to behave in such situation.","Palestinians were victims of harassment, even when they played no part in the Intifada.","The Palestinian workers, who flooded into Israel every day, fuelling its economy, could now have a say.","RAJI SOURANI","PALESTINIAN CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS","Israel claimed the occupied territories were a model of coexistence between Arabs and Israelis.","A model for Arabs to learn from.","The Intifada erupted even though Palestinian workers made a living, Workers suffered the worst humiliation and discrimination from the occupation.

It also decided to call up its reserve forces.","AMRAM MITZNA","RETIRED ISRAELI GENERAL – LEADER OF THE MIDDLE FRONT","In the beginning of the Intifada, December 1987, we’ve had about i think 13 – 15 companies, which means, let's say 1000 soldiers – a month later i think we've have had, let’s say 8,000 – 10,000 soldiers, most of them regular forces because we understood that we need to bring a lot of soldiers if we want to meet the challenges that we have met in every corner and at every road junction in the west bank….","But we didn’t try to be in each village and each place but understood that we have to make the transportation safer on the main roads and of course to protect the settlers.","Yitzhak Rabin was Israel’s defence minister at the time. He’s been accused of ordering the Israeli army to break the bones of Palestinians","A charge he always denied.","Amram Mitzna","Retired Israeli General – leader of the middle front","Well, I understood immediately that the soldiers will translate the aim of the minister of defence, Yitzhak Rabin, and what they heard him say – they will translate it immediately to a behaviour which I didn’t want them to take.","I was afraid, I was worried, - you know soldiers are watching television or listening to the radio and the channel of command instead of going minister of defense, chief of staff, me, the commander of the west bank , the talion leaders, company leaders squad leaders. The channel of command will go directly from television to the soldiers.","On the 26th February 1988, four Israeli soldiers attacked two Palestinian teenagers with stones.","Wael Hassan Jawda was one of the victims.","WAEL HASSAN JAWDA","BROKEN BONES VICTIM","We were herding our sheep in the mountains. I was surprised to see soldiers. They started hitting me and shouting. They spoke Hebrew, which I didn’t understand. One thing sticks in my mind. On one soldiers’ helmet was written: ‘Born to kill Palestinians’. He read it to me and told me what it meant.","A nearby CBS News cameraman filmed what happened. The footage was shown all over the world.","People thought the teenagers had been tortured to death, but they survived, and were thrown in jail.","While he was under arrest, Jawda met Amram Mitzna, the commander of Israel’s Central command.","WAEL JAWDA","VICTIM OF THE ‘BONES BREAKING’ POLICY","I remember he told me ‘the whole world thinks you’re both dead’. He was an Israeli soldier and he said: 'The whole world thinks you’re dead'.","The film made by the journalists, regardless of their nationality, was a good thing. If they hadn’t filmed it, I could have been treated worst. Maybe I’d still be in jail today.","The Israeli army used a range of weapons against peaceful demonstrators.","In March 1988, during an International Women’s Day protest in occupied East Jerusalem, they sprayed tear gas.","Randa Jaberi took part in that march decades ago.","RANDA JABERI","INTIFADA PROTESTER","This is Salah e-Din Street.

Saari Hamayel remembers what happened in his village of Beita.","SAARI HAMAYEL","FORMER ACTIVIST","On 6th April, the settlers entered Beita from the east. The person leading them was called Roman Aldubi. He entered with 15 other people. They had guns, Uzzis and M16s. They approached the young people. It was planting season. They opened fire on the first person they saw. He died on his way to hospital.","His name was Moussa Abu Shamsa. He was 19 years old.","On the same day, Teresa Borat, a 15-year-old Israeli settler was killed.","According to witnesses, Borat was shouting at Roman Al Dubi to stop him from opening fire, but he killed her, either deliberately or by accident.","Israel accused Palestinians of killing Borat and ordered the destruction of the village of Beita. An autopsy confirmed she’d been killed by Al Dubi’s gun.","Two hundred Palestinians were arrested. Fourteen homes were demolished and eight activists expelled from the Palestinian territories.","Hamayel’s home was demolished. He was exiled.","His pregnant wife, Sa’eda and their two daughters managed to escape.

My mum told me to leave home, because we didn’t know what would happen. So we stayed where we could, and we stayed in this miserable place.","Israel’s response to the Intifada wasn’t limited to targeting protestors. It also involved the demolition of Palestinian homes. During the first year of intifada, Israel demolished more than 350 in Gaza alone.","AMRAM MITZNA","RETIRED ISRAELI GENERAL – LEADER OF THE MIDDLE FRONT","Demolishing homes came basically from the British period of time in Palestine. And we adapted it, years before the Intifada. Of course during the Intifada we used it more often. We felt we have to deter in some way the way that families and friends and villagers supported those who didn’t just demonstrate but used Molotov cocktails or even hand grenades or weapons.","And in order to deter, it’s not enough to catch them and to bring them to court and to put them into prison, so we used the deportation, we used also the idea of blowing houses.","The Intifada also saw 600,000 Palestinians arrested. Including those who had no connection with the uprising at all. Issa Faleh is one of them.","ISSA FALEH","ARRESTED BYSTANDER","I was at home, talking with my nephew.

I raised the issue along with Abu Jihad in a meeting that lasted more than four hours on 12th April 1988, four days before Abu Jihad was killed.","Abu Jihad’s role in unifying the PLO with the Intifada leaders made him a prime target for the Israelis. On the 16th of April 1988, an Israeli cell attacked his house in Tunis and killed him.","MOSHE ARENS","ISRAEL’S FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER 88-90","The tactic to be used in fighting terrorism has included going after some of the leading people on the assumption that people in leading positions of a terrorist movement know that they are being targeted – makes it difficult for them to concentrate their mind on what they are really set out to do, namely, acts of terrorism. And if you happen to get somebody who is very capable in the leadership – whoever replaces them after he is gone will not be as capable as the man who is gone.","When the Intifada began, Arab leaders were unsure of what to make of it. But as it entered its second year, no one could ignore the powerful popular movement. Politically for the Palestinians, things were shifting.","There was a growing sense of disillusionment with the PLO’s strategy of negotiating with Israel.","The UNLU became increasingly influential as some Palestinians lost trust in the PLO.","Yasser Arafat’s approval of UN Security Council resolution 242, which implicitly recognised Israel, was seen by some as a step towards peace.","But his decision seemed at odds with the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.","RAJI SOURANI","PALESTINIAN CENTRE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS","I think the Intifada lasted 20 months, strong and firm. The UNLU controlled its organisation, direction, achievements and political goals.","The Intifada message was simple. No one of us expected it to end the occupation.

And it’s not the Israeli message that the occupied territories were a model of coexistence","Palestinians were projecting a powerful new image to the world.","In the next episode we will hear more stories from the people who lived through the Intifada nearly three decades ago.

And how it transformed Palestinian society forever."],["In December 1987, the Palestinian territories erupted with massive protests aimed at ending Israel’s military occupation.","The Intifada was rooted in civil disobedience.","Palestinians armed with nothing but stones confronted one of the world’s best-equipped armies.","As the Intifada entered its second year, Palestinians devised new ways to fight.","Resistance meant withholding taxes, home schooling, even planting gardens and writing protest songs.","We ignited the eighth of December. And the whole world was watching us. For you, Palestine, we walked on embers. Victory is near.

They patrolled until 1:30am and entered people’s homes to return their IDs.","This was a new kind of nationalist civil disobedience.","For Palestinians, throwing away their identity cards was a new form of protest – a matter of choice.","But the Israelis forced them to dispose of other things as well… Any national symbol… Including the flag.","MARIAM ABU SAADA","IYAD’S MOTHER","‘Palestine’ was written on our pillows. That was forbidden. We tore it off. We didn’t let them see it. It was forbidden to have anything Palestinian. The Palestinian Keffiyeh was forbidden. Everything was forbidden.","That was it.

Raise your hands and make the sign of victory.’","I asked why he said that. He said: ‘Don’t you dare cry for me.’","By the end of the 1980s, the Israeli army adopted a new line of attack: Taking direct aim at Palestinian schools.","At the time, Fayez Arafat was a preparing to write his final exams.","FAYEZ ARAFAT","INTIFADA ACTIVIST","They didn’t let us study. I studied for my final school exams five times.","On three of those occasions, they arrested us just before the exams.","One secret service officer said it was forbidden to take my final exams or attend university.","Once, it even happened the day of the exam.","They controlled our education. If you missed the exam, that was it. Once, they took me the night before an Arabic exam.","The next day, they freed me at 12.30pm, after the exam was over.

Studying at home helped.","We gathered school-aged children. An adult was at home.","My sister and I taught groups of children.","They came here as though they were coming to school.","Even though the room was too small, no one felt uncomfortable.","At the heart of this Intifada was a dispute over land.","Another form of protest saw Palestinians try to reclaim it, in a small but symbolic way.","Farming was banned without a permit. So they planted kitchen gardens.","TAGHRID JUMA","INTIFADA ACTIVIST","The Palestinian resistance strengthened through community projects. Many families took part. If a family had a small garden, they planted vegetables.","If they had roofs where they could grow food, they did.","In the occupied territories, the Intifada raged on...","But as the conflict deepened, an entirely new front started to emerge:","Culture became a key battlefield.","A new generation of artists found inspiration in the suffering that surrounded them.","They used music, song and poetry to project their plight to their own people, and out to the world.","KHALID JUMA","MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEE","We used art in the interest of the Intifada.","When someone was killed, we wrote a song about them.","We named them. People sang these songs.","We formed a band in Rafah, The Southern Band for Popular Arts.","We played Dabke, traditional Palestinian music and dance.","We wrote music and lyrics for our songs and created dances.","We performed at national celebrations, and events for Fatah and the Islamic Front.

I was driving my mum’s new car with all my tapes. The car was confiscated.","Before that, only cars containing weapons were confiscated. Even cars containing political leaflets weren’t confiscated.

Through songs and dance, we fought the occupation in our own way.","KHALID QATAMESH","PALESTINIAN MUSICIAN","The Israelis targeted young people’s gatherings. Any gathering, of young boys, of young girls, anyone.","In 1988, thirteen 15-years old dancers were jailed.","So we worked with a clandestine band from Ramallah.

They became popular during the Intifada and are still popular today.","People knew them by heart. The mosques played these songs because they were emotional and created enthusiasm for the Intifada.","At ceremonies, we sang classical repertoire at first. Then we sang about struggle and nation. Many of our songs were for Palestine.","There’s one nobody can forget. They still ask us to play it.

This happened a lot.","In the outskirts of Rafah alone, four or five fugitives’ homes were demolished.","The Intifada had entered a new phase.","Palestinian resistance hardened.","So did the Israeli response.","Palestinian hospitals began treating new kinds of injuries.","Dr. Hani Rustum is a physician at Gaza’s Shifa hospital.","During the Intifada, many of his patients bore the scars of torture.","Others had been shot with rubber bullets.","HANI RUSTUM","PHYSICIAN , SHIFA HOSPITAL, GAZA","We saw new types of injuries. First from tear gas and rubber bullets. Then from beatings and real bullets. If someone was hit on the head, it could break their skull and lead to death. If someone had been hit on the eye, sometimes we had to remove it.","In the beginning, people couldn’t accept these injuries. Some lost children. Some had their children jailed for life. Someone who lost a hand felt luckier than someone than who lost two feet. If they lost an eye they felt luckier than someone who lost two eyes.","Someone in a wheelchair felt luckier than someone paralysed at home.","People had faith. They accepted what happened to them.","Between 1988 and 1992, Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service was accused of torturing Palestinian prisoners during interrogation.","Hundreds more alleged mistreatment and daily humiliation at the hands of their Israeli prison guards.","Muayyad Abdul Samad spent 26 years in Israeli jail.","He was 19 years old when he was sentenced.","MUAYAD ABDUL SAMAD","FORMER ACTIVIST AND FREED PRISONER","Physical torture was common. It hadn’t been banned by the Israeli courts.","They didn’t let me sleep for four days. I couldn’t close my eyes. If I fell off the chair, they poured a bucket of cold water on me. Or they hit me on the stomach. They called that ‘swings’.","My feet were tied under an iron chair.","My hands were tied like this. During interrogation, they hit me in the stomach. Also on my genitals.","Another form was shaking. They tied me to a chair and lifted me by my clothes, ordering me to talk To the point that I fainted. I felt my brain hit my skull.","More and more Palestinian prisoners were behind bars.","But their influence reached beyond prison.","They wrote letters that were smuggled out by their families. These communiques, delivered to Palestinian political leaders, helped shape the direction of the uprising.","MUAYAD ABDUL SAMAD","FORMER ACTIVIST AND FREED PRISONER","During prison visits, we smuggled out notes written on cigarette paper. We wet it with water and a bit of glue until it became a paper this size. On this, we wrote about 50 pages.","We wrote at night in tiny writing. We wrapped it in a capsule, nylon and thread. And put more nylon over it. We burnt it from both sides so it became a capsule.","We hid it in our mouths or swallowed it.","Prisoners’ mothers would play a crucial role.

There were economic, social cultural ties in all parts of that territory. That continuity was interrupted for a period of two decades between 1948 and 1967 and the Israeli occupation in 1967 actually brought those territories together, it’s strange to say now because the situation is so different. But actually the Israeli occupation brought back the freedom of the movement. And between 1967 and 1991, there was a good ability to travel between Gaza, Israel and the West Bank. The rule was that anybody could travel between Gaza, Israel and the West Bank unless specifically prohibited.","For the first time, the Palestinians who left in their entire country from the river to the sea experienced life as a people again for the first time after 19 years, as one people and one regime.","And for the first time since 19 years, people could renew their family relations, friendship relations, economic relations. The country was open to the people. Why was it open? Because of a simple military order.

Or for sure the possibility of a state would be gone. A separate Palestinian state.","As Israel occupied both Gaza and the West Bank, it began building settlements in both territories.","It also appeared to many that it was adopting separate policies towards each of them.","Israel kept the separation territories of 1948.","They kept the Egyptian cultural, health and education systems in Gaza","They also kept the Jordanian system in the West Bank.","Israel policy has never been based on bringing Gaza and the West Bank together.","The aim has always been to create different atmospheres and cultures, here and there.","The same applies to East Jerusalem.","Even IDs differ between Gaza and the West Bank.","I think Israel deliberately planned it that way.","The result was a build-up of Palestinian unrest producing, in 1987, the First Intifada or Uprising…in both territories.","In the early nineties, more freedom came to the former Soviet Union and post-Cold War Europe; and apartheid ended in South Africa.","But in the new world order, Israel’s move in the occupied territories was in the opposite direction.","When Israel understood after the fall of the soviet union after the changes in south Africa. After the end of the cold war. It understood it would have to come with a solution to this problem. So everybody expected the cold-hot war would end here by solution like South Africa. Israel understood from the early 90s that it has to forge a two state solution. First step was to make Gaza an isolated enclave. And actually Perez and others hoped to make out of Gaza the state of Palestine.","The eve of the gulf war.

Enforced restrictions, criminal penalties for entering without a permit. The Oslo period brought about a period of increased travel restrictions. And they’ve gone worse since then.","At certain moments, some Israeli politicians like Shimon Peres hoped to convince Arafat to declare it a Palestinian state and later on develop the west bank into something else. The idea then in the 90s was that ‘ok we cannot annex Gaza, so let’s get rid of it’","Rabin is quoted to have said ‘I wish Gaza drowned in the sea’.","This is by the way one of the main stupidities and mistakes of Palestinian negotiators that did not understand.

It gradually gathered strength and support, particularly in the Gaza Strip.","What I blame Palestinians for, is that since the 90s they didn’t pay attention to the great Israeli efforts to push Gaza away.","The leadership came to a ready-made situation of closure and they took it for something natural, part of the occupation they did not understand that for people here in the country, it was a major setback and major regression. The deterioration and worsening in their life than before. They did not understand it.","The leadership of Hamas knew that it cannot go anymore to the west bank, they forgot about it.

But if you want to see your mother because you haven’t seen her in 20 years that doesn’t count","Maslek, the human rights association, knows about the case involving my wife and children","If I entered via the Erez crossing, my case would be closed.","Separating two brothers, one from Gaza","and the other from the West Bank is unacceptable.","I can’t digest this.","After years of waiting, the Israeli authorities finally agreed to change Kawkab Al Hajran’s Gaza ID to a West Bank one.","But a condition was that she presents herself to the Israeli Civil Administration in the West Bank to complete the change-over process.","However, the Israeli security services refused to issue her with a permit to travel from Gaza to the West Bank to complete the Civil Administration procedure…","AMIRA HASS","ISRAELI JOURNALIST, HAARETZ NEWSPAPER","People cannot go to study in Birzeit. I mean people from Rafah, young students whose studies were cut in the middle because they did not get a permit. I remember very well gazans telling when they went, by all kinds of crazy ways, to the west bank they went to finish their studies so they could not come for three years to see their parents because they could not depend on permits. You might get a permit to Gaza but you might not get a permit to go back to the west bank. So they remained in the west bank for years and when they departed from their parents in the Gaza strip, their parents cried. Their mothers and sisters cried as if they were going to the moon. I remember one said to his mom ‘why are you crying, I’m not going to Saudi Arabia.’ He went to birzeit from Rafah. The mother said ‘you’re going much further away than Saudi Arabia’","The distance, the real distance became so much longer and at a certain point impassable.","The Gaza Music School…","It has applied for its Palestinian students to take part in a summer camp in the Occupied West Bank for the first time.","But to travel, they need the Israeli authorities to open the Erez military checkpoint on the border of the Gaza Strip.","We’re coming but we have to wait a while .","Any news from your side?","OK bye.","We can’t cancel the trip.","We decided to go to the border crossing.","It’s normal.","We’ll go. If they don’t let us in, we’ll come back.","But we can’t cancel the trip.","We’ll probably cross.","We called the liaison office and they said we’ll get in.","IBRAHIM ENNAJAR","Director, Gaza Music School","The kids still have hope. They want to see their country for the first time.","They want to see the other part of Palestine.","They want to meet other Palestinians","to make new friends.","These are simple things but they’re not allowed","to cross at the Erez checkpoint.","We already have exit permits.","The security services agreed to give them to us.","All that remains is to allow them to travel.","It didn’t work out for the music students. The Israeli Erez military border crossing remained closed to them.","They’ll have wait for their cultural visit to the Occupied West Bank…","YISRAEL HASSON","ISRAELI POLITICIAN","If Palestinians want the two territories to be one ,","They shouldn’t launch rockets against Israel, nor attacks us .","This is an of issue of two sides","Israel must secure its needs.","I am supposed to be safe. If not, they’ll get nothing.","They’ll only get hammer blows on their heads.","This should be made clear.","There were suicide attacks that gave Israel reasons and explanations why it is tightening the closure. And tightening is the bureaucracy of giving permits and not giving permits. The fact is the very idea of disconnecting and imposing these permits and restriction regime started in 91 long before we dreamed about the suicide attacks","Of course there are security concerns. But the way the policy works is not about security concerns. We were representing five women who were trying to reach Birzeit for their studies. Most of them were women’s’ rights activists who were trying to reach gender studies and human rights at Birzeit university in the West Bank. In some cases, two of those women have been given permits for two reasons. One for medical care and another for a three-day conference. But they weren’t allowed to stay in the west bank for the months necessary to complete their degree. So if there were a security claim against them they would not have been allowed to travel to enter Israel and the west bank. So if a person is allowed to do that for a three day conference. There’s no security reason not to allow her to stay and complete a degree. Unless what you’re trying to do is to prevent long term ties between Gaza and the west bank as a way of separating the two territories.","In August 2005, Israel withdrew unilaterally from the Gaza Strip. This signified an abandonment of both the peace process…and any notion of a future Palestinian state.","After Hamas won the 2006 general election to take control of Gaza, Israel began a blockade of the territory in 2007 - which continues to tighten today…","Dr. NASHAT-Al AQTASH","POLITICAL ANALYST AND ACADEMIC","The Israeli unilateral withdrawal reinforced the idea of separation.","Israel knew that remaining in Gaza would be very costly.","Protecting a few settlements with heavy military, costs Israel a lot.","Snipers and Palestinian resistance became a heavy burden for Israel.","I exerted a lot of pressure to build a wall around the Gaza Strip.","I opposed the building of a wall around Judea and Samaria.","But I supported the building of a wall around Gaza.","I said we should separate them.","We started by cutting the relationship between them","to save lives.","It had already cost us lives.","So the reality was of encouraging Palestinians in Gaza. This is the worst- they don’t have settlements there now but they are in big prison. And the process was clear from the very start. The process of imprisonment of Gazans was very clear. There was no political understanding on part of the Palestinian parties to do something about it.","In June 2007 Fatah and Hamas fought a five day conflict, the Battle of Gaza. Hamas won the struggle for power - but, in doing so, reinforced the division between it and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.","The division confirms something that already existed.","The separation existed before and so did different policies.","The Palestinian National Authority had different policies","in the West Bank from Gaza.","When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip, they reinforced this division.","The geographical and cultural divisions had always existed","between Gaza and the West Bank.","Did the Palestinian Authority succeed","in softening this cultural division through the media at least ?","No, not at all.","The same policy is being carried out. Everyone is implementing Israel’s policy.","Unconsciously, whether they like it or not.","We are now carrying Israel policy. I mean both Hamas and Fatah. Both are doing it unwillingly","SARI BASHI","ISRAELI LAWYER, FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT CENTRE","The policy that’s been in place long before the hamas government took over. the ban on students travelling from gaza to the west bank has been in place for the last 14 years in 2000. Long before these kind of claims about ties to iran. So I think there’s something else going that’s beyond security.","AMIRA HASS","ISRAELI JOURNALIST, HAARETZ NEWSPAAPER","I don’t need secret documents to see that since 91 when the world was expecting to have a solution of two states based on UN resolutions; Israel did everything possible to foil these solutions. Disconnecting, settlements, fragmenting the area in the west bank. Disconnecting east Jerusalem from the west bank. These were the policies. This fragmentation actually, if you look at it from an architectural point of view is very similar to what Israel is doing in Israel. What Israeli authorities are doing to Palestinians in Israel. Palestinians live in disconnected enclaves; the land has been taken from most of them. So they are more and more crammed in. this is very similar to the reality of the enclaves that Israel imposes on Palestinians in the west bank. Gaza became now the biggest enclave but it has the most draconian restrictions on movement. In the West Bank you still have some illusion of freedom of movement. But of course any moment the Israelis can block you from going one enclave to another.","Israel has launched a series of military attacks on Gaza in recent years. It usually maintains that these are in response to Hamas checkpoint attacks or rockets launched from Gaza….","….throughout 2008 and 2009…","….while the blockade continued…with all the shortages that entails…","The Israeli attacks continued in 2012…..","","In June 2014, Fatah and Hamas resolved their differences sufficiently to announce a Palestinian Unity Government. But because of the geographical divide, ministers have been unable physically to sit around the same table.","MUFID AL HASSAINA","MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HOUSING","We were hoping to meet Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah.","Unfortunately we haven’t so far.","We just meet through video conferencing.","I don’t see any sign of a Palestinian state. Even on 1967 boundaries.","given what’s happening on the ground.","How could a Palestinian state be established","while the Gaza and the West Bank are separate territories?","Israel attacked the Gaza Strip again for almost two months, on a huge scale, in July and August 2014, leaving over two thousand Palestinians dead.","Meanwhile, life in the Occupied West Bank seemed to carry on, almost as normal, such is the disconnect between the two territories.","Today some academics and politicians in Israel clearly say","the solution is the creation of small city enclaves .","These enclaves should be geographically and culturally disconnected .","If things don’t change","in 10 years Hebron will be different from Ramallah and so on.","This way Israel would get rid of the most densely populated areas","that threaten the demographic balance.","Israel would also control the space between these enclaves.","An example is the area between Turmus Ayya and Zatara.","More and more settlements have spread there in the past three years.","They’re a barrier between the north and the centre.","There’s also the container barrier and the settlements","separating Jerusalem from the northern and central areas.","The plan is to end any geographical link between Palestinian territories.","Israeli policy is to create barrier settlements","to separate blocs of Palestinians from one another.","YISRAEL HASSON","ISRAELI POLITICIAN","The best case scenario is enclaves in Judea and Samaria in 10 to 15 years.","Palestinians are losing the opportunity to establish a state.","They’re gradually losing this opportunity","if things continue this way.","I suppose by 2030, the political discussion will be about enclaves within the West Bank.","How Jenin and Nablus enclaves communicate.","That’s what will happen."]]
