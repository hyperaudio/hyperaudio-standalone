It refers to the border separating pre-1967 Israel from the Occupied Palestinian Territories.</p>\n      \n      <p>The demarcation line, laid down in the Armistice Agreements of 1949, is the internationally recognised border. However, it is important to note that Israel has never specified the boundaries of its own state.</p>",
